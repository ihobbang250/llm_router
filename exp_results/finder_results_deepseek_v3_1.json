        "ATM Program. In March 2021, we established the 2021 ATM Program through which we may issue and sell shares of our common stock having an aggregate gross sales price of up to $750 million. Sales under the 2021 ATM Program, or any similar successor program, may be made by means of ordinary brokers' transactions on the NYSE or otherwise at market prices prevailing at the time of sale, at prices related to prevailing market prices or, subject to our specific instructions, at negotiated prices. We intend to use the net proceeds from any sales under the 2021 ATM Program, or any similar successor program, for general corporate purposes, which may include (1) the funding of future acquisitions or investments or (2) the repayment or repurchase of any outstanding indebtedness. See also note 10 to our consolidated financial statements. As of February 20, 2024, we had $750 million of gross sales of common stock availability remaining on our 2021 ATM Program.\nCredit Facility.

In practical terms, this means that (1) the company can access a substantial pool of funds, which provides strategic flexibility; (2) the conditions on these instruments (for example, using the ATM program to issue new shares at prevailing market prices, the CP program with a set outstanding balance, and a large undrawn balance under the credit facility) allow management to potentially deploy capital for buybacks when market conditions are favorable, such as when the share price appears undervalued; and (3) the use of proceeds is not exclusively tied to share repurchases but is balanced against other uses like funding acquisitions, capital expenditures, or repaying debt. \n\nConsequently, in deciding on the timing and scale of share repurchases, Crown Castle’s management would weigh several factors: • The amount of available liquidity (with $750 million remaining under the ATM program, $7.0 billion in undrawn credit, and $578 million from the CP program already outstanding) • Market conditions and prevailing share prices (since these facilities often involve transacting at market prices or prices that move in tandem with market conditions) • The broader capital allocation strategy, including opportunities for growth investments and debt management. \n\nThus, the outlined terms and conditions effectively provide the company with a robust toolkit, allowing management to execute share repurchases when market conditions justify it, without being overly constrained by a lack of capital. This operational flexibility supports a dynamic decision-making process where repurchase timing and scale are optimized relative to prevailing market valuations and broader strategic priorities."

      "ground_truth": "The data provided does not include the impact of CIP (Construction in Progress) on the cash outflows, meaning that the reported net capital expenditures omit a potentially significant set of investments. Adjusting for CIP would likely increase the total capital expenditures reported by the company because these investments, while capitalized and not immediately expensed, still represent cash outlays used to construct or acquire long‐term assets. In turn, this adjustment would have several implications for the interpretation of the company's financial health:\n\n1. Net Capital Expenditure: Including CIP would result in a higher total of capital investments. This means that the company is committing more cash into asset development than the published figures suggest, potentially altering ratios and metrics that assess asset growth and reinvestment.\n\n2. Cash Flow Analysis: Excluding CIP may give a rosier picture of the company’s cash outflows over the reported period. Once CIP is accounted for, cash flow from investing activities would show a larger outflow, which might temper short-term cash flow metrics and signal a larger commitment to future growth or ongoing projects.\n\n3. Impact on Future Depreciation and Earnings: Though CIP increases the asset base only once completed, its inclusion would imply that future depreciation expenses will rise. This means that while the immediate impact is on cash flows rather than earnings, future profitability metrics may be affected as these assets begin to be depreciated.\n\n4. Financial Risk and Capital Allocation: Recognizing CIP as part of the capital expenditures provides a more complete picture of the company’s capital allocation. A higher level of CIP might suggest a strategic focus on long‐term capacity expansion, which could be positive if those investments yield returns. Conversely, it may also indicate increased risk if these projects face delays or cost overruns.\n\nThus, adjusting for CIP is crucial for a comprehensive view of the company’s investment activities, and it could change the narrative around both the measurement of capital spending and the assessment of the company’s future financial performance."

The associated cost of the treasury stock fell from $1,903.0 million to $1,896.6 million, a decrease of about $6.4 million. \n\nThis modest reduction indicates that while there was slight activity in managing treasury stock, the overall position remained relatively stable. The incremental decrease in both the number of shares held and their carrying cost suggests that the company is actively managing its capital structure through share repurchases and possibly uses these shares for purposes such as supporting liquidity, aiding in employee compensation plans, or offsetting dilution from equity issuances. Further, the continuation of a robust share repurchase program and dividend increases reflects a broader capital management strategy focused on returning capital to shareholders, thereby underlining confidence in its balance sheet and prospects."

      "ground_truth": "The available data shows that as of December 31, 2023, Paycom Software, Inc. no longer had the revolving credit facility debt that was present at $29,000 as of December 31, 2022. This yearly improvement in the debt position could influence investor perceptions in several ways:\n\n1. Reduced Leverage and Financial Risk: Investors often view a reduction in debt as a sign that a company is lowering its financial leverage and, consequently, the risk associated with high debt levels. Removing the revolving credit facility may suggest that the company is relying less on external financing to fund its operations, which can lead to a lower risk profile.\n\n2. Improved Cash Flow and Liquidity: Eliminating existing long-term debt can free up cash previously earmarked for interest and principal payments. This can indicate better cash flow management and a stronger liquidity position, reassured by investors that the company is efficiently deploying its capital.\n\n3. Operational Discipline and Financial Management: A significant debt reduction year-over-year tends to signal disciplined financial management. It reflects the company's ability to generate sufficient operational cash flow to not only support growth and operations but also to control and reduce its debt. This disciplined approach can be perceived as a marker of overall operational efficiency and strong corporate governance.\n\n4. Enhanced Creditworthiness and Lower Borrowing Costs: By showing an improvement in the debt position, the company may enhance its credit profile. Investors might expect that the company will face lower borrowing costs in the future if it needs external capital, which again is a positive indicator of sound financial management.\n\nIn summary, the removal of the revolving credit facility debt from one year to the next stands as a strong indicator of operational and financial discipline, thereby potentially boosting investor confidence in the company’s strategy and risk management."

      "ground_truth": "To calculate the current debt-to-equity ratio, we first need to identify the total debt and total equity from the December 31, 2023 balance sheet. Under liabilities, debt typically includes both short‐term borrowings (including the current portion of long-term debt) and long-term debt.\n\n1. Total Debt:\n   - Short-term borrowings and current portion of long-term debt: $1,123 million\n   - Long-term Debt: $10,842 million\n   - Total Debt = $1,123 + $10,842 = $11,965 million\n\n2. Equity:\n   - We use the SLB stockholders' equity (which excludes noncontrolling interests) amount of $20,189 million. (If one were to include noncontrolling interests, total equity would be $20,189 + $1,170 = $21,359 million; however, the common approach in calculating a debt-to-equity ratio is to use the parent company’s equity.)\n\n3. Debt-to-Equity Ratio Calculation:\n   - Debt-to-Equity Ratio = Total Debt / Stockholders’ Equity = $11,965 million / $20,189 million ≈ 0.59\n\nInterpretation of Leverage Impacts:\n\n• Financial Risk: A debt-to-equity ratio of approximately 0.59 indicates that the company is using a moderate level of leverage. This level of debt is not excessively high relative to its equity, which suggests that SLB is not overly reliant on debt financing. However, any debt level introduces fixed obligations (interest and principal payments) that can increase financial risk during economic downturns or periods of reduced cash flow.\n\n• Flexibility: With a moderate leverage profile, the company generally maintains greater financial flexibility, meaning it has room to raise additional capital if needed (either through issuing debt or equity) without significantly overburdening its balance sheet. It also implies that the current capital structure is balanced well enough to support ongoing investments and operations while not compromising the credit profile excessively.\n\nIn summary, SLB’s debt-to-equity ratio of about 0.59 suggests a balanced approach that supports growth while keeping financial risks at a manageable level."

This structure means that major decisions, including those related to financial reporting and corporate governance, are not made unilaterally but are instead subjected to oversight and validation by multiple leaders within the organization. In particular:\n\n1. Leadership Oversight: The explicit involvement of the Principal Executive Officer (CEO) and the Principal Financial Officer (CFO) implies that the company’s top management is directly responsible for the financial strategies and operations, ensuring that such strategies align with the organization’s overall vision and regulatory standards.\n\n2. Board Accountability: By having additional directors sign off on key statements, the organization demonstrates that its decision-making process includes independent oversight. This involvement helps to safeguard against unilateral decisions, offering a system of checks and balances that strengthens internal controls and compliance.\n\n3. Collaborative Decision-Making: The listing of multiple officers and directors as signatories reflects a collaborative approach in critical corporate decisions. This ensures that various perspectives are considered before finalizing decisions, thus mitigating the risk of oversight or mismanagement.\n\nOverall, this governance framework supports strong accountability as it involves rigorous review and collective endorsement of the company’s financial practices, thereby reinforcing investor confidence and the robustness of internal controls."

        "We face competition from other railroads, motor carriers, ships, barges, and pipelines. Our main railroad competitor is Burlington Northern Santa Fe LLC. Its primary subsidiary, BNSF Railway Company (BNSF), operates parallel routes in many of our main traffic corridors. In addition, we operate in corridors served by other railroads and motor carriers. Motor carrier competition exists in all three of our commodity groups. Because of the proximity of our routes to major inland and Gulf Coast waterways, barges can be particularly competitive, especially for grain and bulk commodities in certain areas where we operate. In addition to price competition, we face competition with respect to transit times, quality, and reliability of service from motor carriers and other railroads. Motor carriers in particular can have an advantage over railroads with respect to transit times and timeliness of service. However, railroads are much more fuel-efficient than trucks, which reduces the impact of transporting goods on the environment and public infrastructure, and we have been making efforts to convert truck traffic to rail. Additionally, we must build or acquire and maintain our rail system, while trucks, barges, and maritime operators are able to use public rights-of-way maintained by public entities. Any of the following could also affect the competitiveness of our transportation services for some or all of our commodities, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity: (a) improvements or expenditures materially increasing the quality or reducing the costs of these alternative modes of transportation, such as autonomous or more fuel efficient trucks, (b) legislation that eliminates or significantly increases the size or weight limitations applied to motor carriers, or (c) legislation or regulatory changes that impose operating restrictions on railroads or that adversely affect the profitability of some or all railroad traffic. Many movements face product or geographic competition where our customers can use different products (e.g., natural gas instead of coal, sorghum instead of corn) or commodities from different locations (e.g., grain from states or countries that we do not serve, crude oil from different regions). Sourcing different commodities or different locations allows shippers to substitute different carriers and such competition may reduce our volume or constrain prices. Additionally, any future consolidation of the rail industry could materially affect our competitive environment."

      "ground_truth": "The available reference material outlines key competitive factors and regulatory challenges that can influence both capital expenditures (CapEx) and valuation. Specifically, legislative or regulatory changes can impact Union Pacific in two major ways:\n\n1. Capital Expenditure Requirements: \n   • If new environmental or operational regulations are imposed on railroads—such as stricter emissions standards or safety protocols—Union Pacific may be required to accelerate investments in technology, upgraded equipment, and infrastructure improvements to remain compliant. \n   • Conversely, if regulatory changes ease constraints on motor carriers (for example, by lifting weight limitations or relaxing operating restrictions), competition could intensify. This might force Union Pacific to invest even more heavily in its rail network and service improvements to maintain a competitive edge against faster or more flexible motor carriers.\n   • In both scenarios, additional CapEx may be needed to address compliance costs, service quality enhancements, or efficiency improvements, ultimately increasing the company’s ongoing financial outlays.\n\n2. Overall Valuation Implications:\n   • Higher capital expenditures can pressure cash flows in the near term, potentially leading to lower free cash flow margins. This may prompt investors to adjust discount rates upward to account for increased risk, thereby putting downward pressure on valuation multiples.\n   • Increased regulatory burdens or competitive pressures might also heighten business risk perceptions. This risk can result in a higher cost of capital by affecting debt or equity pricing, indirectly impacting the overall valuation of the firm.\n   • Conversely, proactive CapEx leading to improved efficiency and operational reliability could mitigate some of the negative valuation impacts if the investments translate into higher long-term productivity and better competitive positioning.\n\nIn summary, legislative or regulatory changes impacting both railroads and motor carriers could drive up Union Pacific’s capital expenditure requirements either through mandatory compliance or as a strategic response to increased competition. This, in turn, could adversely affect its valuation by affecting future cash flows, increasing its cost of capital, and altering risk assessments by investors. While exact figures cannot be calculated without detailed financial statements, these qualitative impacts are critical in understanding how regulatory shifts might affect Union Pacific’s financial outlook."

For example:\n\n• The presence of a dedicated President and Chief Executive Officer (Christopher L. Winfrey) and a Chief Financial Officer (Jessica M. Fischer) indicates centralized leadership that is crucial for strategic and financial oversight. Investors generally view such clear demarcations of duties favorably because they imply focused responsibility for both operational performance and financial reporting.\n\n• The inclusion of a Chief Accounting Officer (Kevin D. Howard) along with several directors who hold significant roles (such as the Non-Executive Chairman, Eric L. Zinterhofer) suggests robust financial controls and governance practices. This typically reduces risks related to misreporting or management misalignments, thereby enhancing investor confidence.\n\n• The diversity of the board of directors, which includes members with varied expertise, supports multifaceted oversight of capital allocation and risk management practices. In competitive markets, investors value such a mix as it indicates that the company is well-positioned to respond to economic changes and shifts in competitive conditions, factors that help support stable or rising valuation metrics.\n\nIn summary, while the data primarily lists names and roles without deep background narratives, the leadership structure itself contributes to a perception of strong corporate governance, lowered risk through effective oversight, and strategic focus.

        "Our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions, including those that impact our most critical accounting policies. We base our estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. A summary of significant accounting policies is also provided in the notes to our consolidated financial statements (see Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements). Actual results may differ from these estimates. We believe the following are our most critical accounting policies and estimates:\nCONSOLIDATION: Arrangements that are not controlled through voting or similar rights are accounted for as variable interest entities (“VIEs”). An enterprise is required to consolidate a VIE if it is the primary beneficiary of the VIE.\n\nUnder certain circumstances when we enter into arrangements for the formation of joint ventures, a VIE may be created.  The primary factors that require the most judgment in determining whether the joint venture is a VIE are whether the decisions that most significantly impact the entity’s economic performance were controlled by the equity holders as a group, and whether the joint venture has sufficient equity to finance its activities without additional subordinated support.\nIf the joint venture is determined to be a VIE, we perform a qualitative analysis, including considering which party, if any, has the power to direct the activities most significant to the economic performance of each VIE and whether that party has the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could be significant to the VIE. If we are determined to be the primary beneficiary of the VIE, the assets, liabilities and operations of the VIE are consolidated within our financial statements. Otherwise, our investment is generally accounted for under the equity method. Our ability to correctly assess the influence or control over an entity affects the presentation of the investment in our consolidated financial statements.\nREAL ESTATE ASSETS: We account for the acquisition of stores, including by merger and other acquisitions of real estate, in accordance with ASC 805-10, \"Business Combinations.\" We use our judgment to determine if assets acquired meet the definition of a business or if the acquisition should be considered an asset acquisition. We must make significant assumptions and estimates in determining the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets and liabilities acquired and consideration transferred. These fair value estimates are sensitive to: price of land per square foot and current replacement cost estimates, including adjustments for the age, class, height, square footage, condition, location, and turnkey factor. These assumptions and estimates require judgment, and therefore others could come to materially different conclusions as to the estimated fair values, which could result in differences in depreciation and amortization expense, gains and losses on the sale of real estate assets, and real estate and intangible asset values.\nEVALUATION OF ASSET IMPAIRMENT: Long lived assets held for use are evaluated for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that there may be impairment. We review each store at least annually to determine if any such events or circumstances have occurred or exist. We focus on stores where occupancy and/or rental income have decreased by a significant amount. For these stores, we determine whether the decrease is temporary or permanent and whether the store will likely recover the lost occupancy and/or revenue in the short term. In addition, we review stores in the lease-up stage and compare actual operating results to original projections. We may not have identified all material facts and circumstances that affect impairment of our stores. No material impairments were recorded in the year ended December 31, 2023.\nWe evaluate goodwill for impairment at least annually and whenever events, circumstances, and other related factors indicate that fair value of the related reporting unit may be less than the carrying value. If the fair value of the reporting unit is determined to exceed the aggregate carrying amount, no impairment charge is recorded. Otherwise, an impairment charge is recorded to the extent the carrying amount of the goodwill exceeds the amount that would be allocated to goodwill if the reporting unit were acquired for estimated fair value. No impairments were recorded in our evaluations for any period presented herein.\nDERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES: We hold a number of derivative instruments which we use to hedge our exposure to variability in expected future cash flows, mainly related to our interest rates on variable interest debt. We do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes. We assess our derivatives both at inception, and on an ongoing quarterly basis, for whether the derivatives used in hedging transactions are effective. The rules and interpretations relating to the accounting for derivatives are complex. Failure to apply this guidance correctly may require us to recognize all changes in fair value of the hedged derivative in earnings, which may materially impact our results.\nINCOME TAXES: We have elected to be treated as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code. In order to maintain our qualification as a REIT, among other requirements, we are required to distribute at least 90% of our REIT taxable income to our stockholders and meet certain tests regarding the nature of our income and assets. As a REIT, we are not subject to U.S. federal income tax with respect to that portion of our income which meets certain criteria and is distributed annually to our stockholders. We plan to continue to operate so that we meet the requirements for taxation as a REIT. Many of these requirements, however, are highly technical and complex. For any taxable year that we fail to qualify as a REIT and for which applicable statutory relief provisions did not apply, we would be subject to U.S. federal corporate income tax on all of our taxable income for at least that year and the ensuing four years. We could also be subject to penalties and interest, and our net income may be materially different from the amounts reported in our financial statements.\nWe have elected to treat certain corporate subsidiaries, including Extra Space Management, Inc., as a TRS. In general, a TRS may perform additional services for tenants and generally may engage in any real estate or non-real estate related business. A TRS is subject to U.S. federal corporate income tax and may also be subject to state and local income taxes. Interest and penalties relating to uncertain tax positions will be recognized in income tax expense when incurred. If tax authorities determine that amounts paid by any of our TRSs to us are not reasonable compared to similar arrangements among unrelated parties, we could be subject to a penalty tax on the excess payments."

Additionally, for stores in the lease-up phase, they compare actual operating results to the original projections. If a decrease is determined to be permanent, or the store is not expected to recover quickly, this may lead to an impairment charge. Such a charge would be reflected as a reduction in asset value and would consequently impact future earnings by increasing depreciation expense or impairing asset values, potentially lowering reported net income. Conversely, if the declines are temporary and recovery is expected, no impairment charge is recorded, which would help keep future earnings unaffected by such adjustments."

        "Risk Management and Strategy\nMatch Group maintains an enterprise-wide information security program designed to identify, protect against, detect, respond to, and manage reasonably foreseeable cybersecurity risks and threats. Our information security teams, led by our Senior Vice President, Security Engineering, are responsible for assessing and managing our exposure to information security risks, including by:\n•Implementing and enforcing physical, operational and technical security policies, procedures and controls;\n•Conducting, and engaging independent third-party experts to conduct, regular internal and external security assessments and audits, including assessments of the security posture of third-party vendors and partners;\n•Collaborating with our development teams to engineer and integrate security throughout the product development lifecycle;\n•Implementing scalable and continuous data protection practices; and\n•Detecting, monitoring, investigating, and responding to potential security threats and incidents.\nWith a focus on both product and enterprise security, the security program has been set up to protect our information systems from cybersecurity threats as part of our development lifecycles and our ongoing business operations. We implement various technical and operational processes to help prevent, identify, escalate, investigate, resolve, and recover from vulnerabilities and security incidents in a timely manner. These include, but are not limited to, monitoring and detection tools, internal and third-party penetration testing, continuous testing by a dedicated red team, a comprehensive bug bounty program to allow security researchers to assist us in identifying vulnerabilities in our services before they are exploited, and annual and ongoing security awareness training for employees.\nWe have implemented cybersecurity controls to detect and address threats arising from our use of third-party service providers. Security risk assessments are conducted during onboarding, contract renewal, and when an increased risk profile is identified. We also require specified security controls and other responsibilities from our service providers and we investigate security incidents affecting them as deemed necessary.\nOur policies, standards, processes and practices for assessing, identifying, and managing material risks from cybersecurity threats are integrated into our overall risk management program and are based on frameworks established by the International Organization for Standardization (“ISO”) and other applicable industry standards. Our cybersecurity policies, standards, processes and practices are regularly assessed by consultants and external auditors. These assessments include a variety of activities, including information security maturity assessments, audits and independent reviews of our information security control environment and operating effectiveness. Cybersecurity processes are adjusted based on the information provided from these assessments. We have also obtained industry certifications and attestations that demonstrate our dedication to protecting the data our users entrust to us, including Tinder obtaining certification for its Information Security Management System (ISMS) under the ISO/IEC 27001:2022 standard.\nloy external services to conduct tabletop exercises, penetration and vulnerability testing, simulations, and other exercises to evaluate the effectiveness of our information security program and improve our security measures and planning across Match Group’s businesses. The results of these assessments are reported to the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors.\nWe have established standardized and comprehensive incident response and recovery plans across Match Group’s businesses. Our incident response and recovery plans address — and guide our employees, management, and our Board of Directors on — our response to a cybersecurity incident, and our procedures with regard to material incidents. We regularly test and evaluate the effectiveness of our incident response process.\nOur systems periodically experience directed attacks intended to lead to interruptions and delays in our service and operations as well as loss, misuse or theft of personal information (of third parties, employees, and our users) and other data, confidential information or intellectual property.\nWe have not identified risks from cybersecurity threats, including from previous cybersecurity incidents, that have materially affected us. However, we face ongoing risks from cybersecurity threats that, if realized, are reasonably likely to materially affect our business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition. Any significant disruption to our service or unauthorized access to our systems could result in a loss of users and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Further, a penetration of our systems or a third-party’s systems or other misappropriation or misuse of personal information could subject us to business, regulatory, litigation and reputation risk, which could have a negative effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. While Match Group maintains cybersecurity insurance, the costs related to cybersecurity threats or disruptions may not be fully insured. For additional discussion of cybersecurity risks, see “Item 1A Risk factors—Risks relating to our business—We may not be able to protect our systems and infrastructure from cyberattacks and may be adversely affected by cyberattacks experienced by third parties.”\nGovernance\nBoard Oversight\nOur Board of Directors, in coordination with the Audit Committee, oversees our management of cybersecurity risk, including our annual enterprise risk assessment, where we assess key risks within the company, including security and technology risks and cybersecurity threats. The Audit Committee directly oversees our cybersecurity program. The Audit Committee receives quarterly cybersecurity updates from management, including risk assessments, progress of risk reduction initiatives, external auditor feedback, control maturity assessments, and relevant internal and industry cybersecurity incidents. Cybersecurity reviews by the Audit Committee or the Board of Directors generally occur quarterly, or more frequently as determined to be necessary or advisable.\nManagement’s Role\nOur cybersecurity program is managed by our SVP, Security Engineering, who reports to our Chief Business Affairs and Legal Officer. Our SVP, Security Engineering, has over 20 years of industry experience, including serving in similar roles leading and overseeing cybersecurity programs at other public companies. Our information security program encompasses partnerships among teams that are responsible for cyber governance, prevention, detection and remediation activities within our cybersecurity environment. Team members have relevant certifications, educational and industry experience, including experience holding similar positions at other large technology companies. The information security teams provide regular reports to senior management and other relevant teams on various cybersecurity threats, assessments and findings. Our information security leadership reports directly to the Audit Committee or the Board of Directors on our cybersecurity program and efforts to prevent, detect, mitigate, and remediate issues. We also maintain an escalation process to inform senior management and the Board of Directors of material issues and make determinations with respect to any required disclosures."

      "ground_truth": "The provided data outlines comprehensive cybersecurity protocols and robust board-level oversight mechanisms at Match Group. These measures contribute significantly to its risk management profile in several ways. First, effective cybersecurity protocols—which include rigorous internal and external assessments, continuous monitoring, a dedicated red team, and ongoing employee training—help reduce the likelihood and potential impact of cyberattacks. These protocols decrease the probability of costly security breaches that might otherwise disrupt operations or result in significant liabilities, thereby lowering overall business risk.\n\nSecond, the active involvement of the Board of Directors and the Audit Committee—through regular reviews, cybersecurity updates, and close monitoring of risk assessments—ensures that cybersecurity risks are not only identified early but are managed at the highest levels of governance. This board-level oversight provides an extra layer of accountability and strategic decision-making, reassuring investors that the company is well-equipped to handle cybersecurity challenges.\n\nFrom a valuation perspective, a robust risk management profile can enhance investor confidence by reducing the uncertainty and volatility associated with potential cybersecurity incidents. This lower risk profile can result in more favorable risk-adjusted discount rates in valuation models, potentially supporting a higher enterprise value. Additionally, companies with strong cybersecurity and governance practices are more appealing to investors, as they signal disciplined risk management and strong operational controls—factors that can drive a premium in their market valuation.\n\nOverall, Match Group’s proactive approach to cybersecurity and its integrated board-level oversight help mitigate both direct financial liabilities from cyber incidents and indirect impacts such as reputational damage. This stable risk management environment makes the company more attractive to investors looking for lower exposure to operational disruptions and strong governance practices."

      "ground_truth": "The provided information allows us to qualitatively assess correlations between the senior executives’ historical roles and Agilent’s potential for earnings stability and growth. Several key points emerge:\n\n1. **Diverse Industry Experience**: Many executives have held leadership roles at other prominent firms such as Hewlett-Packard, Bio-Rad, and Thermo Fisher Scientific. These companies are known for robust operational standards and strong market positions. The exposure to different business environments and industries suggests that these leaders bring a broad strategic perspective, risk management skills, and operational best practices, all of which can contribute to stable earnings.\n\n2. **Operational and Financial Expertise**: Several executives have experience handling large-scale operations, investor relations, and financial governance (e.g., the Chief Financial Officer with experience at Hologic and Johnson & Johnson, and other roles at Hewlett-Packard). This blend of operational and financial acumen is likely to enhance Agilent’s capital allocation and risk management, contributing to both earnings stability and growth.\n\n3. **Track Record in Transformational Roles**: The historical roles include positions such as President, Corporate Controllership, and Chief Operating Officer. This history of steering business units and transformation initiatives suggests that the leadership team is capable of driving efficiency improvements and strategic growth initiatives. Such capabilities are generally correlated with enhanced earnings performance over time.\n\n4. **Cross-Industry Best Practices**: Having served in multiple industry segments, the executives are likely to integrate best practices from various sectors. This can result in improved operational efficiencies, innovation in product development, and enhanced customer relationships, all contributing to more predictable and potentially growing earnings.\n\nWhile no direct quantitative calculations are possible with the given qualitative leadership biographies, the inference is that a management team with such extensive and varied experience is well-equipped to manage complexities and execute strategies that support stable cash flows and continual growth. In summary, the historical roles indicate that the leadership team has repeatedly demonstrated an ability to drive success in challenging environments. This experience, when translated into Agilent’s operations, has the potential to enhance earnings stability and facilitate long-term growth."

For example, the maximum remaining capacity for each reporting period ranged from approximately 1.55 million (December) to 1.83 million (October) shares. Even though the values differ by month, these figures represent the unspent part of the program and highlight the company’s cautious, yet flexible approach to capital allocation.\n\nMore specifically, maintaining a sizeable repurchase capacity allows Grainger to deploy capital opportunistically. The company can use this flexibility to enhance shareholder value—by repurchasing shares when market conditions are favorable—without exhausting its liquidity. At the same time, the steady reduction in the available capacity over the three-month period (as the plan is partially executed) suggests that management is consistently aligning its buyback activities with current market evaluations and internal assessments of liquidity and growth prospects. \n\nIn the broader context of capital allocation and liquidity management, having a reserved repurchase capacity signals that Grainger is balancing the return-of-capital strategy with investments in its core operations and other possible uses of cash (such as acquisitions, debt reduction, or capital expenditures). This approach is generally a sign of robust financial health, as it indicates that the company is confident in its ability to generate free cash flow while still having ample resources available for strategic share repurchases. However, for a complete picture of the alignment with the overall strategy, additional details (like free cash flow trends, liquidity ratios, and competing capital uses) would be needed. Nonetheless, the remaining repurchase capacity data provided does indicate a disciplined capital allocation framework where share repurchases serve as one of multiple tools to optimize shareholder returns while maintaining financial flexibility."

      "ground_truth": "The expansion of the repurchase program by an additional $4.9 billion (including the recent $400 million) implies that Henry Schein, Inc. has strong liquidity and robust cash flow, which enables the company to allocate significant funds toward returning value to shareholders. This decision indicates management's confidence in the company's current operations and financial stability. By committing to a large share buyback, the Board is suggesting that it views the stock as potentially undervalued and believes that using excess cash for repurchases is a more beneficial use of capital compared to other alternatives, such as acquisitions or reinvestment in operations. In summary, this move highlights both the company's solid liquidity position and its positive outlook on future earnings and overall business performance."

        "As of December 31, 2023, the Company is a lessee of corporate office space, ground leases and a parking lease associated with various consolidated properties, and equipment. Lease terms for the Company's office leases, in general, range between 5 to 10 years while ground leases and the parking lease have terms typically ranging from 20 to 85 years. The corporate office leases occasionally contain renewal options of approximately five years while certain ground leases contain renewal options that can extend the lease term from approximately 10 to 39 years.\n\nA majority of the Company’s ground leases and the parking lease are subject to changes in the Consumer Price Index (\"CPI\"). Furthermore, certain of the Company’s ground leases include rental payments based on a percentage of gross or net income. While lease liabilities are not remeasured as a result of changes in the CPI or percentage of gross or net income, such changes are treated as variable lease payments and recognized in the period in which the obligation for those payments was incurred.\n\nThe Company’s lease agreements do not contain any residual value guarantees or restrictive covenants.\n\nOperating lease right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term at commencement date. Because most of the Company’s leases do not provide an implicit rate, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company had no material finance leases.\n\nSupplemental consolidated balance sheet information related to leases as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 is as follows ($ in thousands): \nClassification\t\tDecember 31, 2023\t\tDecember 31, 2022\nAssets\t\t\t\t\t\n     Operating lease right-of-use assets\tOperating lease right-of-use assets\t\t$\t63,757 \t\t\t$\t67,239 \t\n          Total leased assets\t\t\t$\t63,757 \t\t\t$\t67,239 \t\nLiabilities\t\t\t\t\t\n     Operating lease liabilities\tOperating lease liabilities\t\t$\t65,091 \t\t\t$\t68,696 \t\n          Total lease liabilities\t\t\t$\t65,091 \t\t\t$\t68,696 \nThe components of lease expense for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 were as follows ($ in thousands): \n \tDecember 31, 2023\t\tDecember 31, 2022\nOperating lease cost\t$\t6,789 \t\t\t$\t6,697 \t\nVariable lease cost\t1,961 \t\t\t1,750 \t\nShort-term lease cost\t186 \t\t\t204 \t\nSublease income\t(500)\t\t\t(418)\t\n          Total lease cost\t$\t8,436 \t\t\t$\t8,233 \t\n \n\nA maturity analysis of lease liabilities as of December 31, 2023 is as follows ($ in thousands): \nOperating Leases\n2024\t$\t7,251 \t\n2025\t6,887 \t\n2026\t5,035 \t\n2027\t3,421 \t\n2028\t3,102 \t\nThereafter\t129,452 \t\nTotal lease payments\t$\t155,148 \t\nLess: Imputed interest\t(90,057)\t\nPresent value of lease liabilities\t$\t65,091 \t\n \n\nLease term and discount rate information for leases at December 31, 2023 and 2022 are as follows: \nDecember 31, 2023\t\tDecember 31, 2022\nWeighted-average of remaining lease terms (years)\t\t\t\n     Operating Leases\t40\t\t40\nWeighted-average of discount rates\t\t\t\n     Operating Leases\t5.03 \t%\t\t5.01 \t%\n \n\nPractical Expedients\n\nLeases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet.

      "ground_truth": "The provided lease expense breakdown gives several actionable insights about Essex Property Trust’s operational cost structure and impact on profitability:\n\n1. **Operating Lease Cost**: This is the largest component (approximately 80% of the total lease-related outlay) and represents the fixed base rent expense for the occupied properties. Its stability implies a predictable, recurring cost that helps in forecasting and budgeting, albeit it also commits the company to long-term obligations.\n\n2. **Variable Lease Cost**: Accounting for a significant portion of the lease expense (roughly 20-25% of the gross lease expense before offsets), this component is sensitive to factors such as the Consumer Price Index (CPI) or as a percentage of the property’s income. This linkage means that these costs can rise with an improving economic or occupancy environment, potentially aligning expenses more closely with revenue – which can be beneficial in strong market conditions, but also introduces an element of variability or risk if revenues drop.\n\n3. **Short-Term Lease Cost**: Although relatively small (typically around 2% of the gross lease expense), these costs are associated with leases of 12 months or less. Their minimal amount suggests that most of the company’s commitments are for longer, more stable periods, reducing the frequency of lease renewals or transitions that could disrupt operations.\n\n4. **Sublease Income**: The presence of sublease income (acting as a cost offset of about 5-6% of gross lease outlays) indicates that Essex Property Trust is able to monetize some of its leased space. This reduces the net lease expense and directly contributes to profitability. It demonstrates a flexible asset management strategy where underutilized space is subleased to generate revenue.\n\nOverall, the breakdown illustrates that while the company has a significant fixed cost base through operating leases – which aids in long-term planning – it also retains a degree of operational flexibility through variable costs and sublease income. The variable lease costs tie expenses to performance measures (like CPI or income percentages), which can help align costs with revenues. Simultaneously, the ability to generate sublease income helps mitigate some of the inherent cost of long-term lease commitments, thereby cushioning the impact on profitability. These insights are important for understanding both the stability of recurring expenses and the impact of external factors on the overall cost structure."

For 2022:\n   - Operating Income = $2,198,154\n   - Operating Revenues = $12,289,336\n   - Operating Margin = 2,198,154 / 12,289,336 ≈ 0.1788 or 17.88%\n\n3. For 2023:\n   - Operating Income = $2,399,335\n   - Operating Revenues = $11,910,705\n   - Operating Margin = 2,399,335 / 11,910,705 ≈ 0.2014 or 20.14%\n\nObservations:\n• In 2021, the operating margin was approximately 20.22%. \n• In 2022, the margin declined to about 17.88%, suggesting a dip in operational efficiency likely due to increased costs or lower relative efficiency in cost management.\n• By 2023, the operating margin bounced back to roughly 20.14%, nearly returning to the 2021 level.\n\nConclusion:\nThis trend indicates that after a decline in 2022, Eversource Energy restored its operational efficiency by 2023. The temporary dip suggests some operational challenges or cost pressures in 2022, but the quick recovery to a margin near 20% implies that management was effective in addressing these issues and maintaining overall efficiency in generating operating income relative to revenues."

        "Cybersecurity Risk Management and Strategy\n\nThe security of our products, services and corporate network is a key priority for our business. We recognize the importance of assessing, identifying, and managing material risks associated with cybersecurity threats (as defined in Item 106(a) of Regulation S-K). These risks include, among other things, operational risks, intellectual property theft, fraud, extortion, harm to employees, customers, business partners or the riding public, violation of privacy or security laws and other litigation and legal risk, and reputational risks.\n\nOtis has taken a risk-based approach to cybersecurity, which considers the sensitivity and volume of the relevant data, the potential effects on third parties and individuals, the needs of our business, and the costs and / or practicality of remediation. Based on this qualitative and quantitative assessment, we determine if identified cybersecurity risks are at an acceptable level, or should be mitigated or transferred.\n\nWe have implemented cybersecurity policies throughout our operations, including designing and incorporating cybersecurity, as appropriate, into our products and services while they are being developed. Our enterprise risk management (“ERM”) process considers cybersecurity threat risks alongside other company risks as part of our overall risk assessment process. Additionally, cybersecurity functional groups incorporate external research and intelligence gathering to keep the organization informed of new and evolving cyber risks.\n\nWe have implemented several cybersecurity processes, technologies, and controls to aid in our efforts to assess, identify, and manage material risks from cybersecurity threats, and to protect against, detect and respond to cybersecurity incidents (as defined in Item 106(a) of Regulation S-K), including, among others, the following:\n\n•established a global Security Operations Center to support visibility to cybersecurity incidents in real time;\n•require all salaried Otis colleagues to complete an annual cybersecurity training program where specific threats and scenarios are highlighted based on our analysis of current risks to the organization;\n•conduct regular phishing email simulations for employees and contractors with access to corporate email systems to enhance awareness and responsiveness to such possible threats;\n•maintain a robust Cybersecurity Incident Response Plan, which provides a framework for handling cybersecurity incidents based on, among other factors, the potential severity of the incident and facilitates cross-functional coordination across Otis;\n•periodically run tabletop exercises to simulate a response to a cybersecurity incident and use the findings to improve our processes and technologies;\n•maintain cybersecurity insurance and regularly review our policy and levels of coverage based on current risks;\n•monitor emerging data protection and cybersecurity laws, and implement changes to our processes, systems and offerings designed to comply, and through policy, practice and contract (as applicable) require employees, as well as third parties who provide services on our behalf, to treat customer information and data with care;\n•conduct several cyber-specific internal audits per year; and\n•engage consultants and other third parties in connection with our cybersecurity practices.\n\nAs part of the above processes, we conduct monthly third-party scanning of our network. Otis also applies a risk-based approach to mitigate cybersecurity risks associated with our use of third-party service providers, including those in our supply chain that have access to our customer and employee data or our systems. Third-party risks are included within our ERM process. In addition, cybersecurity considerations affect the selection and oversight of our third-party service providers. We perform due diligence on third parties that have access to our most critical systems, data or facilities that house such systems or data, and based on our risk assessment put in place contractual undertakings and oversight, to manage and reduce the risks associated with such third-party vendors. Such contractual undertakings include requirements to comply with administrative, technical and physical safeguards to satisfy the requirements for certification under ISO 27001, to provide notification of cyber incidents involving our systems or data and an agreement to be subject to cybersecurity audits, which we conduct as appropriate.\n\nWhile Otis has not experienced a material cybersecurity incident to date, please see Item 1A in this Form 10-K for more information regarding cybersecurity-related risks that could materially affect our business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition, under the headings “Information security, data privacy and identity protection may require significant resources and present certain risks to our business, reputation and financial condition”, “Our business and financial performance depend on continued substantial investment in information technology infrastructure, which may not yield anticipated benefits, and may be adversely affected by cyber-attacks on information technology infrastructure and products and other business disruptions” and “We depend on our intellectual property, and have access to certain intellectual property and information of our customers, suppliers and distributors; infringement or failure to protect our intellectual property could adversely affect our future growth and success”.\n\nCybersecurity Governance\n\nOtis has established a three-level governance model for managing cybersecurity risks. Cybersecurity risks are overseen by the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors (the \"Board\"). Our Chief Digital Officer (“CDO”) and Chief Information Security Officer (“CISO”) regularly brief the Audit Committee and other members of the Board on the Otis Cybersecurity Program and cyber-threat landscape, including twice in 2023. Our Cybersecurity Program is directed by both our CDO and CISO and we have established a Cyber Governance Council and Steering Committee made up of senior management (including our CEO). These committees are informed about and monitor the prevention, mitigation, detection, and remediation of cybersecurity incidents through their management of, and participation in, the cybersecurity risk management and strategy processes described above, including the operation of our incident response plan.\n\nMembers of our Board also received briefings on risks associated with generative artificial intelligence, data protection (including data privacy laws) and our IT infrastructure in 2023. In 2022, in addition to periodic briefings on cybersecurity, the Audit Committee members participated in a simulated cybersecurity incident tabletop exercise and toured our Security Operations Center. Several members of our Board hold a CERT Certificate in Cybersecurity Oversight issued by the CERT Division of the Software Engineering Institute at Carnegie Mellon University, and in early 2023, two members of our Audit Committee attended a continuing education class related to cybersecurity through the National Association of Corporate Directors (“NACD”).\n\nOur CDO and CISO collectively have over 20 years of prior work experience in various roles involving managing information security, developing cybersecurity strategy and implementing effective information and cybersecurity programs, as well as relevant degrees and certifications, including Certified Information Security Manager certification and NACD Cyber training. All Otis colleagues engaged in cybersecurity are required to have a baseline certification (such as Security+, CISSP or CISM), as well as an operational cyber certification (for example, incident response or forensics analysis)."

      "ground_truth": "Otis Worldwide’s robust cybersecurity risk management and incident response strategies are designed to mitigate the potential costs and disruptions associated with cyber incidents, which can have a significant impact on both earnings and market positioning. First, by establishing a comprehensive set of protocols – including a global Security Operations Center, regular employee training, proactive threat scanning, incident response planning, and involvement in continuous improvements through tabletop exercises and third-party audits – the company is reducing operational and reputational risks. This risk reduction can help avoid potential financial losses from cyber incidents, litigation, regulatory fines, and disruption costs, thereby protecting future earnings.\n\nSecond, because cybersecurity incidents can damage customer trust and lead to diminished market share, a demonstrated commitment to cybersecurity can enhance competitive positioning. Customers, partners, and investors are more likely to trust and do business with companies that effectively manage cybersecurity risks, which can translate into revenue growth. In addition, proactive cybersecurity governance and detailed board-level oversight (including education in cybersecurity) signal to the market that Otis is prepared to adapt to evolving threats; this can be a competitive advantage in attracting and retaining business, particularly in sectors sensitive to security issues.\n\nThird, the company’s integrated approach – blending risk assessments with technological and process controls – supports continuity of operations under adverse conditions. This operational resilience translates to more predictable cash flows and potentially lower cost of capital, indirectly contributing to sustainable earnings growth over the long term.\n\nIn summary, by reducing the chance of costly disruptions and enhancing trust among stakeholders, Otis’s cybersecurity strategies are likely to support improved profitability and firm competitive positioning, which can fuel future earnings growth."

This may translate into initiatives to improve employee engagement, foster a more agile organizational culture, or even drive innovation through better alignment between human capital and business objectives.\n\nSimilarly, the elevation of John P. 'Jack' Molloy to Chief Operating Officer indicates a prioritization of operational excellence and efficiency. His prior role in products and sales suggests that the company is placing greater emphasis on integrating operational processes with market and customer-facing strategies. Such a shift could be aimed at streamlining operations, reducing time-to-market for new products, or improving overall customer satisfaction — all of which are key drivers of future growth.\n\nIn essence, these appointments indicate that Motorola Solutions is potentially rebalancing its focus: enhancing human resources and operational leadership, which may not only improve internal efficiency and corporate culture but also support long-term growth objectives by enabling quicker, more efficient responses to market changes."

      "ground_truth": "The provided data underscores that Republic Services places a premium on internal development, as evidenced by executives like Jon Vander Ark and Brian Bales who have risen through the company over many years. This deep bench of leadership supports long-term growth and capital allocation strategies in several important ways:\n\n1. Continuity and In-Depth Company Knowledge: Long-tenured executives bring a thorough understanding of the company’s operations, culture, and strategic priorities. Their experience from entry-level to senior roles translates into informed and consistent decision-making, which is critical when planning sustainable long-term growth.\n\n2. Strategic and Patient Capital Deployment: Leaders who have been ingrained in the company’s ethos tend to adopt a long-term perspective. This likely leads to a disciplined approach to capital allocation—prioritizing investments that build lasting competitive advantage rather than pursuing short-term gains.\n\n3. Risk Management and Stability: Internally promoted executives are often better positioned to foresee and mitigate risks, as they have historical insight into previous challenges and successes. Their familiarity with the company’s operational nuances reduces the uncertainties that might otherwise come with external hires.\n\n4. Cross-Functional Expertise and Alignment: As these leaders have progressed through different areas of the organization, from marketing and operations to finance and human resources, they bring a well-rounded perspective. This facilitates greater alignment across various parts of the company, ensuring that growth initiatives and capital expenditures are well-integrated and effectively executed.\n\nOverall, Republic Services’ strategy of nurturing and promoting long-standing talent not only bolsters operational consistency and accountability but also provides a stable foundation for making prudent, long-term strategic investments essential for sustainable growth."

A breakdown of the changes is as follows:\n\n• Americas: Adjusted EBITDA rose from $1,521,775 in 2022 to $1,613,696 in 2023 – an increase of approximately $91,921 or about 6%. \n\n• EMEA: Adjusted EBITDA increased from $1,109,502 in 2022 to $1,251,276 in 2023 – an increase of roughly $141,774 or about 12.8%. \n\n• Asia-Pacific: Adjusted EBITDA went up from $738,423 in 2022 to $836,869 in 2023 – an increase of approximately $98,446 or about 13.3%.\n\nThus, while all regions experienced growth in adjusted EBITDA, the strongest operational improvements in percentage terms were observed in the Asia-Pacific region (approximately 13.3%) followed closely by the EMEA region (around 12.8%). The Americas region, although showing positive growth, had a more modest improvement at around 6%."

        "Unless otherwise stated, the terms \"we,\" \"us,\" \"our\" and the \"company\" refer to Campbell Soup Company and its consolidated subsidiaries.\nWe are a manufacturer and marketer of high-quality, branded food and beverage products. We organized as a business corporation under the laws of New Jersey on November 23, 1922; however, through predecessor organizations, we trace our heritage in the food business back to 1869. Our principal executive offices are in Camden, New Jersey 08103-1799.\nOn March 12, 2024, we completed the acquisition of Sovos Brands, Inc. (Sovos Brands) for total purchase consideration of $2.899 billion. For additional information on this acquisition, see Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOn August 26, 2024, we completed the sale of our Pop Secret popcorn business. For additional information on the divestiture, see Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOur operations, including reportable segments, are described below. Our locations, including manufacturing facilities, within each reporting segment are described in Item 2. Properties.\nReportable Segments\nOur reportable segments are:\n•Meals & Beverages, which consists of our soup, simple meals and beverages products in retail and foodservice in the U.S. and Canada. The segment includes the following products: Campbell’s condensed and ready-to-serve soups; Swanson broth and stocks; Pacific Foods broth, soups and non-dairy beverages; Prego pasta sauces; Pace Mexican sauces; Campbell’s gravies, pasta, beans and dinner sauces; Swanson canned poultry; V8 juices and beverages; Campbell’s tomato juice; and as of March 12, 2024, Rao's pasta sauces, dry pasta, frozen entrées, frozen pizza and soups; Michael Angelo's frozen entrées and pasta sauces; and noosa yogurts. The segment also includes snacking products in foodservice and Canada; and\n•Snacks, which consists of Pepperidge Farm cookies*, crackers, fresh bakery and frozen products, including Goldfish crackers*, Snyder’s of Hanover pretzels*, Lance sandwich crackers*, Cape Cod potato chips*, Kettle Brand potato chips*, Late July snacks*, Snack Factory pretzel crisps*, and other snacking products in retail in the U.S. We refer to the * brands as our \"power brands.\" The segment includes the retail business in Latin America. The segment included the results of our Emerald nuts business, which was sold on May 30, 2023 and our Pop Secret popcorn business, which was sold on August 26, 2024.\nSee Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" for additional information regarding our reportable segments.\nIngredients and Packaging\nThe ingredients and packaging materials required for the manufacture of our food and beverage products are purchased from various suppliers, substantially all of which are located in North America. During 2024, we experienced moderately elevated commodity and supply chain costs including the costs of labor, raw materials, energy, fuel, packaging materials and other inputs necessary for the production and distribution of our products. In addition, many of these items are subject to price fluctuations from a number of factors, including but not limited to climate change, changes in crop size, cattle cycles, herd and flock disease, crop disease, crop pests, product scarcity, demand for raw materials, commodity market speculation, energy costs, currency fluctuations, supplier capacities, government-sponsored agricultural programs and other government policy, import and export requirements (including tariffs), drought and excessive rain, temperature extremes and other adverse weather\nevents, water scarcity, scarcity of suitable agricultural land, scarcity of organic ingredients, pandemics or other local or global health issues, geopolitical conflicts, environmental and other sustainability regulations and other factors that may be beyond our control. To help reduce some of this price volatility, we use a combination of purchase orders, short- and long-term contracts, inventory management practices and various commodity risk management tools for most of our ingredients and packaging. Ingredient inventories are generally at a peak during the late fall and decline during the winter and spring. Since many ingredients of suitable quality are available in sufficient quantities only during certain seasons, we make commitments for the purchase of such ingredients in their respective seasons. We are unable to predict the impact of our ability to source these ingredients and packaging materials in the future, and certain supply pressures may continue throughout 2025. We expect input cost inflation in 2025 to remain at similar levels as 2024, as we continue to see improvement across certain ingredients and packaging materials; however, we could experience unexpectedly high input cost inflation in various categories.\nCustomers\nIn most of our markets, sales and merchandising activities are conducted through our own sales force and/or third-party brokers and distribution partners. Our products are generally resold to consumers through retail food chains, mass discounters, mass merchandisers, club stores, convenience stores, drug stores, dollar stores, e-commerce and other retail, commercial and non-commercial establishments. Our Snacks segment has a direct-store-delivery distribution model that uses independent contractor distributors.\nOur five largest customers accounted for approximately 47% of our consolidated net sales in 2024, 2023, and 2022. Our largest customer, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and its affiliates, accounted for approximately 22% of our consolidated net sales in 2024, 2023, and 2022. Both of our reportable segments sold products to Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. or its affiliates. No other customer accounted for 10% or more of our consolidated net sales.\nTrademarks and Technology\nAs of September 11, 2024, we owned over 3,000 trademark registrations and applications in over 150 countries. We believe our trademarks are of material importance to our business. Although the laws vary by jurisdiction, trademarks generally remain valid and can be renewed indefinitely as long as they are in use and/or their registrations are properly maintained, and they have not become generic. We believe that our principal brands, including Campbell's, Cape Cod, Chunky, Goldfish, Kettle Brand, Lance, Late July, Milano, Pace, Pacific Foods, Pepperidge Farm, Prego, Rao's, Snack Factory, Snyder's of Hanover, Spaghettios, Swanson, and V8, are protected by trademark law in the major markets where they are used.\nAlthough we own a number of valuable patents, we do not regard any segment of our business as being dependent upon any single patent or group of related patents. In addition, we own copyrights, both registered and unregistered, proprietary trade secrets, technology, know-how, processes and other intellectual property rights that are not registered."

According to the provided data, the company uses a mix of purchase orders, both short‐ and long-term contracts, inventory management practices, and various commodity risk management tools. These steps are intended to buffer against the unpredictable shifts in raw material costs associated with factors such as climate change, crop conditions, and geopolitical issues. \n\nIn terms of potential effects on future cash flows, these measures can help stabilize cost fluctuations, thereby reducing the risk of unexpected cash outflows associated with spikes in ingredient and packaging costs. Stability in input costs supports more predictable operational cash flows, which can enhance the company’s ability to plan capital expenditures and manage working capital more effectively. \n\nRegarding capital allocation, maintaining cost volatility at manageable levels could allow the company to better focus on strategic initiatives. With more predictable operating costs, there may be increased confidence in optimizing reinvestment strategies, including funding growth opportunities, strategic acquisitions (such as the recent purchase of Sovos Brands, Inc.), or distributing cash to shareholders via dividends or share repurchases. However, if input cost inflation were to unexpectedly spike, Campbell Soup might need to reallocate capital to ensure continued supply chain resilience, potentially delaying other investments. \n\nOverall, the risk management strategies implemented are designed to safeguard profitability and cash flow stability, which in turn informs more prudent future capital allocation decisions."

      "question": "NII, FTP credit/charge rates impact for FIFTH THIRD BANCORP.",
      "reference": [
        "The Bancorp reports on three business segments: Commercial Banking, Consumer and Small Business Banking and Wealth and Asset Management. Additional information on each business segment is included in Note 31 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Results of the Bancorp’s business segments are presented based on its management structure and management accounting practices. The structure and accounting practices are specific to the Bancorp; therefore, the financial results of the Bancorp’s business segments are not necessarily comparable with similar information for other financial institutions. The Bancorp refines its methodologies from time to time as management’s accounting practices and businesses change.\n\nThe Bancorp manages interest rate risk centrally at the corporate level. By employing an FTP methodology, the business segments are insulated from most benchmark interest rate volatility, enabling them to focus on serving customers through the origination of loans and acceptance of deposits. The FTP methodology assigns charge and credit rates to classes of assets and liabilities, respectively, based on the estimated amount and timing of cash flows for each transaction. Assigning the FTP rate based on matching the duration of cash flows allocates interest income and interest expense to each business segment so its resulting net interest income is insulated from future changes in benchmark interest rates. The Bancorp’s FTP methodology also allocates the contribution to net interest income of the asset-generating and deposit-providing businesses on a duration-adjusted basis to better attribute the driver of the performance. As the asset and liability durations are not perfectly matched, the residual impact of the FTP methodology is captured in General Corporate and Other. The charge and credit rates are determined using the FTP rate curve, which is based on an estimate of Fifth Third’s marginal borrowing cost in the wholesale funding markets. The FTP curve is constructed using the U.S. swap curve, brokered CD pricing and unsecured debt pricing. The Bancorp’s FTP methodology was not adjusted during the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021.\n\nThe Bancorp adjusts the FTP charge and credit rates as dictated by changes in interest rates for various interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and by the review of behavioral assumptions, such as prepayment rates on interest-earning assets and the estimated durations for indeterminate-lived deposits. Key assumptions, including the credit rates provided for deposit accounts, are reviewed annually. Credit rates for deposit products and charge rates for loan products may be reset more frequently in response to changes in market conditions. In general, the charge rates on assets increased since December 31, 2022 as they were affected by the prevailing level of interest rates and by the duration and repricing characteristics of the portfolio. The credit rates for deposit products also increased since December 31, 2022 due to higher interest rates and modified assumptions. Thus, net interest income for asset-generating business segments was negatively impacted by the rates charged on assets while deposit-providing business segments were positively impacted during the year ended December 31, 2023.\n\nThe Bancorp’s methodology for allocating provision for credit losses to the business segments includes charges or benefits associated with changes in criticized commercial loan levels in addition to actual net charge-offs experienced by the loans and leases owned by each business segment. Provision for credit losses attributable to loan and lease growth and changes in ALLL factors is captured in General Corporate and Other. The financial results of the business segments include allocations for shared services and headquarters expenses.

The increase in net income was primarily driven by an increase in net interest income on an FTE basis, a decrease in provision for credit losses and an increase in noninterest income, partially offset by an increase in noninterest expense.\n\nNet interest income on an FTE basis increased $1.3 billion from the year ended December 31, 2022 primarily driven by increases in yields on average commercial loans and leases as well as increases in FTP credit rates on deposits. These positive impacts were partially offset by increases in FTP charge rates on commercial loans and leases as well as increases in rates paid on and average balances of interest checking deposits and increases in rates paid on average savings and money market deposits.\n\nProvision for credit losses decreased $21 million from the year ended December 31, 2022 primarily driven by an increase in the allocated benefit from credit losses related to commercial criticized assets as well as a decrease in net charge-offs related to commercial leases. Net charge-offs as a percent of average portfolio loans and leases were 12 bps for both the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022.\n\nNoninterest income increased $16 million from the year ended December 31, 2022 driven by an increase in commercial banking revenue, partially offset by decreases in leasing business revenue and other noninterest income. Commercial banking revenue increased $56 million from the year ended December 31, 2022 primarily driven by increases in loan syndication fees, institutional brokerage revenue and foreign exchange fees, partially offset by decreases in contract revenue from commercial customer derivatives and merger and acquisition fees. Leasing business revenue decreased $29 million from the year ended December 31, 2022 primarily driven by decreases in operating lease income, lease remarketing fees and leasing business solutions revenue. The decrease in leasing business solutions revenue was related to the disposition of LaSalle Solutions during the second quarter of 2022. Other noninterest income decreased $10 million from the year ended December 31, 2022 primarily due to a decrease in private equity investment income, partially offset by a decrease in net securities losses.\n\nNoninterest expense increased $180 million from the year ended December 31, 2022 driven by increases in other noninterest expense and compensation and benefits, partially offset by a decrease in leasing business expense. Other noninterest expense increased $175 million from the year ended December 31, 2022 primarily driven by increases in allocated expenses and FDIC insurance and other taxes. The increase in allocated expenses was primarily related to cash management services and information technology support services. Compensation and benefits increased $15 million from the year ended December 31, 2022 primarily driven by an increase in base compensation, partially offset by a decrease in performance-based compensation. Leasing business expense decreased $10 million from the year ended December 31, 2022 primarily driven by a decrease in depreciation expense associated with operating lease equipment.\n\nAverage commercial loans and leases increased $1.4 billion from the year ended December 31, 2022 primarily due to increases in average commercial and industrial loans, average commercial mortgage loans and average commercial construction loans, partially offset by a decrease in average commercial leases. Average commercial and industrial loans increased from the year ended December 31, 2022 primarily as a result of higher loan balances in the first half of 2023 driven by production exceeding paydowns, partially offset by a planned reduction in balances in the second half of 2023. Average commercial mortgage loans increased from the year ended December 31, 2022 as loan originations exceeded payoffs. Average commercial construction loans increased from the year ended December 31, 2022 as loan originations exceeded payoffs. Average commercial leases decreased from the year ended December 31, 2022 primarily as a result of a planned reduction in indirect non-relationship-based lease originations.\n\nAverage deposits decreased $1.8 billion from the year ended December 31, 2022 primarily due to decreases in average demand deposits and average savings and money market deposits, partially offset by an increase in average interest checking deposits. Average demand deposits decreased $12.0 billion from the year ended December 31, 2022 primarily as a result of balance migration into interest checking deposits and lower average balances per customer account. Average savings and money market deposits decreased $773 million from the year ended December 31, 2022 primarily due to lower average balances per customer account and balance migration into interest checking deposits. Average interest checking deposits increased $11.0 billion from the year ended December 31, 2022 primarily as a result of balance migration from demand deposits and savings and money market deposits as well as average balance growth.",

The increase was primarily driven by increases in net interest income and noninterest income, partially offset by increases in provision for credit losses and noninterest expense.\n\nNet interest income increased $2.1 billion from the year ended December 31, 2022 primarily due to increases in FTP credit rates on deposits as well as increases in yields on and average balances of loans. These positive impacts were partially offset by increases in rates paid on deposits as well as FTP charge rates on loans.\n\nProvision for credit losses increased $164 million from the year ended December 31, 2022 primarily due to increases in net charge-offs on other consumer loans, commercial and industrial loans, indirect secured consumer loans and credit card. Net charge-offs as a percent of average portfolio loans and leases increased to 68 bps for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to 33 bps for the year ended December 31, 2022.\n\nNoninterest income increased $52 million from the year ended December 31, 2022 primarily driven by increases in mortgage banking net revenue and wealth and asset management revenue. Refer to the Noninterest Income subsection of the Statements of Income Analysis section of MD&A for additional information on the fluctuation in mortgage banking net revenue. Wealth and asset management revenue increased $12 million from the year ended December 31, 2022 primarily driven by an increase in broker income. Noninterest expense increased $126 million from the year ended December 31, 2022 primarily due to increases in other noninterest expense, compensation and benefits and net occupancy and equipment expense. Other noninterest expense increased $53 million from the year ended December 31, 2022 primarily due to increases in allocated expenses, FDIC insurance and other taxes and marketing expense. The increase in allocated expenses was primarily related to information technology support services. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in loan servicing expenses related to the Bancorp’s sales of certain government-guaranteed residential mortgage loans that were previously in forbearance programs and serviced by a third party. Compensation and benefits increased $50 million from the year ended December 31, 2022 primarily driven by an increase in base compensation, which includes the incremental impact of a business acquired in the second quarter of 2022 and the impact of raising the Bancorp’s minimum wage in the third quarter of 2022. Net occupancy and equipment expense increased $19 million from the year ended December 31, 2022 primarily due to an increase in allocated occupancy costs.\n\nAverage consumer loans decreased $116 million from the year ended December 31, 2022 primarily driven by decreases in average residential mortgage loans and average indirect secured consumer loans, partially offset by increases in average other consumer loans and average credit card. Average residential mortgage loans decreased from the year ended December 31, 2022 primarily due to decreases in average residential mortgage loans held for sale as the Bancorp sold government-guaranteed loans that were previously in forbearance programs and also had lower origination volumes. Average indirect secured consumer loans decreased from the year ended December 31, 2022 primarily driven by paydowns exceeding loan originations and a planned reduction in balances. Average other consumer loans increased from the year ended December 31, 2022 primarily driven by originations of point-of-sale solar energy installation loans. Average credit card increased from the year ended December 31, 2022 primarily due to increases in balance-active customers and average balances per balance-active account. Average commercial loans increased $1.1 billion from the year ended December 31, 2022 primarily driven by increases in average commercial and industrial loans and average commercial mortgage loans as loan originations exceeded payoffs.\n\nAverage deposits increased $942 million from the year ended December 31, 2022 primarily driven by an increase in average certificates of deposit, partially offset by decreases in average interest checking deposits, average demand deposits and average savings and money market deposits. Average certificates of deposit increased $6.3 billion from the year ended December 31, 2022 primarily due to higher offering rates. Average interest checking deposits decreased $2.9 billion, average demand deposits decreased $1.7 billion and average savings and money market deposits decreased $749 million from the year ended December 31, 2022 primarily as a result of lower average balances per customer account due to increased consumer spending and balance migration into certificates of deposit. In response to the higher interest rate environment, deposit balances have migrated from noninterest-bearing products to higher interest-bearing products.",
        "General Corporate and Other\nGeneral Corporate and Other includes the unallocated portion of the investment securities portfolio, securities gains and losses, certain non-core deposit funding, unassigned equity, unallocated provision for credit losses or a benefit from the reduction of the ACL, the payment of preferred stock dividends and certain support activities and other items not attributed to the business segments.\n\nNet interest income on an FTE basis decreased $3.2 billion from the year ended December 31, 2022 primarily driven by increases in FTP credits on deposits allocated to the business segments, increases in interest expense on long-term debt and deposits and decreases in interest income on loans and leases. These negative impacts were partially offset by increases in FTP charges to the business segments on loans and leases as well as increases in interest income on investment securities and other short-term investments. The increases in both FTP credits and FTP charges allocated to the business segments were driven by increases in market interest rates. Under the Bancorp’s internal reporting methodology, the Bancorp insulates the business segments from interest rate risk associated with fixed-rate lending by transferring this risk to General Corporate and Other through the FTP methodology. As a result, the amount of FTP credits on deposits earned by the business segments has increased at a faster pace than the amount of allocated FTP charges on loans and leases. If market interest rates remain at current levels, the FTP charges to the business segments for loans and leases will increase over time as fixed-rate loans mature and are replaced with new originations.\n\nProvision for credit losses decreased $192 million from the year ended December 31, 2022 primarily driven by the impact of allocations to the business segments.\n\nNoninterest income increased $46 million from the year ended December 31, 2022 primarily driven by the recognition of net securities gains compared to net securities losses during the prior year, partially offset by a decrease in income from the TRA associated with Worldpay, Inc.\n\nNoninterest expense increased $184 million from the year ended December 31, 2022 primarily driven by increases in FDIC insurance and other taxes due to the FDIC special assessment, compensation and benefits due to higher non-qualified deferred compensation expense and severance expense and an increase in technology and communications expense, partially offset by the impact of increases in corporate overhead allocations from General Corporate and Other to the other business segments.

      "ground_truth": "Both the Commercial Banking and the Consumer & Small Business Banking segments saw notable increases in net interest income that bolstered their operating performance and, in turn, helped improve their segment-level net income. In Commercial Banking, net interest income on an FTE basis increased by about $1.3 billion from 2022 to 2023. This gain was driven primarily by higher yields on its commercial loans and leases along with shifts in the FTP (Funds Transfer Pricing) mechanism. Under the FTP system, higher credit rates assigned on deposit products (which are passed to the segments) helped offset, but did not completely counter, the effect of higher charge rates on loans. Essentially, while the FTP charge rates increased on its asset-generating activities (a slight drag), the concurrent increase in FTP credit rates on deposits (which lower the interest expense when allocated to the segment) resulted in a net benefit to the segment’s interest income.\n\nSimilarly, for Consumer and Small Business Banking, net interest income increased by about $2.1 billion over the same period. In this segment, increased FTP credit rates on deposits—reflecting the higher prevailing interest rates—combined with higher yields on loans contributed to a more robust interest income. Although there was some offset from the increased FTP charge rates applied to its loan portfolio, the net impact was still a substantial uptick in net interest income which in turn supported the improved net income for the segment.\n\nOverall, the FTP framework plays a key role by assigning charge and credit rates that are based on estimated cash flow durations and current market rates. This methodology allows the bank to allocate interest income and expense accurately to each business segment. When deposit products (supporting the funding side) earn higher FTP credit rates, the segments face lower effective interest expenses, boosting net interest income. Conversely, while higher FTP charge rates on loans do add to the cost side of assets, the segments were able to generate sufficient yield on lending to overcome that headwind. The net effect in both segments was a significant increase in net interest income, which materially contributed to their stronger earnings performance during 2023."

        "Segment Results of Operations – 2023 vs. 2022\nThe Company evaluates the operating performance of its operating segments based on financial measures such as revenues and Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as operating income excluding:\n•employee share-based compensation;\n•depreciation and amortization;\n•restructuring and facility consolidation;\n•certain impairment charges;\n•gains and losses on business and asset dispositions;\n•certain inter-segment eliminations;\n•third-party transaction and integration costs;\n•amortization of purchase accounting fair value step-up for content;\n•amortization of capitalized interest for content; and\n•other items impacting comparability.\nThe Company uses this measure to assess the operating results and performance of its segments, perform analytical comparisons, identify strategies to improve performance, and allocate resources to each segment. The Company believes Adjusted EBITDA is relevant to investors because it allows them to analyze the operating performance of each segment using the same metric management uses. The Company excludes employee share-based compensation, restructuring, certain impairment charges, gains and losses on business and asset dispositions, and transaction and integration costs from the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA due to their impact on comparability between periods. Integration costs include transformative system implementations and integrations, such as Enterprise Resource Planning systems, and may take several years to complete. The Company also excludes the depreciation of fixed assets and amortization of intangible assets, amortization of purchase accounting fair value step-up for content, and amortization of capitalized interest for content, as these amounts do not represent cash payments in the current reporting period. Certain corporate expenses and inter-segment eliminations related to production studios are excluded from segment results to enable executive management to evaluate segment performance based upon the decisions of segment executives. Adjusted EBITDA should be considered in addition to, but not a substitute for, operating income, net income, and other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nThe table below presents our Adjusted EBITDA by segment (in millions).\n \t\tYear Ended December 31,\t\t\n \t\t2023\t\t2022\t\t% Change\nStudios\t\t$\t2,183 \t\t\t$\t1,772 \t\t\t23 \t%\nNetworks\t\t9,063 \t\t\t8,725 \t\t\t4 \t%\nDTC\t\t103 \t\t\t(1,596)\t\t\tNM\nCorporate\t\t(1,242)\t\t\t(1,200)\t\t\t(4)\t%\nInter-segment eliminations\t\t93 \t\t\t17 \t\t\tNM",

Generally, timing of revenue recognition is similar to the reporting of third-party transactions. The segment distributing the content, e.g. via our DTC or linear services, capitalizes the cost of inter-segment content transactions, including “mark-ups” and amortizes the costs over the shorter of the license term, if applicable, or the expected period of use.

      "ground_truth": "The data shows that although Warner Bros. Discovery’s Corporate segment remained in a loss position in 2023, its adjusted EBITDA improved by approximately 20% compared to the previous year. This improvement was primarily driven by cost management measures. In particular, the company achieved significant reductions in integration costs—from a reported level of around $1,182 million in 2022 down to $148 million in 2023—which delivered a substantial one‐time benefit. In addition, lower technology‐related operating expenses and cost savings in other areas (often referred to as lower securitization and related expenses) helped mitigate the negative impact of the business challenges in the segment. These strategic reductions in operating costs allowed the Corporate segment to narrow its gap even while still reporting an overall adjusted EBITDA loss."

        "Environmental\nDTE Electric\nAir — DTE Electric is subject to the EPA ozone and fine particulate transport and acid rain regulations that limit power plant emissions of SO2 and NOX. The EPA and the State of Michigan have also issued emission reduction regulations relating to ozone, fine particulate, regional haze, mercury, and other air pollution. These rules have led to controls on fossil-fueled power plants to reduce SO2, NOX, mercury, and other emissions. Additional rule making may occur over the next few years which could require additional controls for SO2, NOX, and other hazardous air pollutants.\nIn 2015, the EPA finalized National Ambient Air Quality Standards (\"NAAQS\") for ground level ozone. In August 2018, the EPA designated southeast Michigan as \"marginal non-attainment\" with the 2015 ozone NAAQS. In January 2022, after collecting several years of data, the State submitted a request to the EPA for redesignation of the southeast Michigan ozone non-attainment area to attainment, and to accept their maintenance plan and emission inventories as a revision to the Michigan State Implementation Plan (SIP). On May 19, 2023, the EPA posted in the Federal Register the redesignation of attainment of the ozone standard for the seven-county Southeast Michigan region. DTE Electric does not expect a significant financial impact related to the ozone NAAQS at this time, pending finalization of the state rules and implementation plans.\nIn May 2023, the EPA proposed new rules to address emissions of GHGs from existing, new, modified, or reconstructed sources in the power sector. DTE Electric provided individual comments on the proposal and also worked with industry partners on a broader set of comments. The financial impact cannot be estimated until a final rule is issued, which is currently expected in early 2024.\nPending or future legislation or other regulatory actions could have a material impact on DTE Electric's operations and financial position and the rates charged to its customers. Potential impacts include expenditures for environmental equipment beyond what is currently planned, financing costs related to additional capital expenditures, the purchase of emission credits from market sources, higher costs of purchased power, and the retirement of facilities where control equipment is not economical. DTE Electric would seek to recover these incremental costs through increased rates charged to its utility customers, as authorized by the MPSC.\nTo comply with air pollution requirements, DTE Electric has spent approximately $2.4 billion. DTE Electric does not anticipate additional capital expenditures for air pollution requirements, subject to the results of future rulemakings. Water — In response to EPA regulations and in accordance with the Clean Water Act section 316(b), DTE Electric was required to examine alternatives for reducing the environmental impacts of the cooling water intake structures at several of its facilities. A final rule became effective in October 2014 which required studies to be completed and submitted as part of the NPDES permit application process to determine the type of technology needed to reduce impacts to fish. DTE Electric has completed the required studies and submitted reports for most of its generation plants, and a final study is in-process for Monroe power plant. Final compliance for the installation of any required technology to reduce the impacts of water intake structures will be determined by the state on a case by case, site specific basis. DTE Electric is currently evaluating the compliance options and working with the State of Michigan on determining whether any controls are needed. These evaluations/studies may require modifications to some existing intake structures. It is not possible to quantify the impact of this rule making at this time.\nAs part of the Monroe power plant NPDES permit, EGLE has added requirements to evaluate the thermal discharge of the facility as it relates to Clean Water Act section 316(a) regulations. DTE Electric has submitted to EGLE a biological demonstration study plan to evaluate the thermal discharge impacts to an aquatic community. After approval of the plan by EGLE and completion of field sampling, data will be processed and compiled into a comprehensive report. At the present time, DTE Electric cannot predict the outcome of this evaluation or financial impact.\nContaminated and Other Sites — Prior to the construction of major interstate natural gas pipelines, gas for heating and other uses was manufactured locally from processes involving coal, coke, or oil. The facilities, which produced gas, have been designated as MGP sites. DTE Electric conducted remedial investigations at contaminated sites, including three former MGP sites. Cleanup of one of the MGP sites is complete, and that site is closed. The investigations have revealed contamination related to the by-products of gas manufacturing at each MGP site. In addition to the MGP sites, DTE Electric is also in the process of cleaning up other contaminated sites, including the area surrounding an ash landfill, electrical distribution substations, electric generating power plants, and underground and above ground storage tank locations. The findings of these investigations indicated that the estimated cost to remediate these sites is expected to be incurred over the next several years. At December 31, 2023 and 2022, DTE Electric had $9 million and $10 million, respectively, accrued for remediation. These costs are not discounted to their present value. Any change in assumptions, such as remediation techniques, nature and extent of contamination, and regulatory requirements, could impact the estimate of remedial action costs for the sites and affect DTE Electric’s financial position and cash flows. DTE Electric believes the likelihood of a material change to the accrued amount is remote based on current knowledge of the conditions at each site.\nCoal Combustion Residuals and Effluent Limitations Guidelines — A final EPA rule for the disposal of coal combustion residuals, commonly known as coal ash, became effective in October 2015 and has continued to be updated in subsequent years. The rule is based on the continued listing of coal ash as a non-hazardous waste and relies on various self-implementation design and performance standards. DTE Electric owns and operates three permitted engineered coal ash storage facilities to dispose of coal ash from coal-fired power plants and operates a number of smaller impoundments at its power plants subject to certain provisions in the CCR rule. At certain facilities, the rule required ongoing sampling and testing of monitoring wells, compliance with groundwater standards, and the closure of basins at the end of the useful life of the associated power plant.\nOn August 28, 2020, Part A of the CCR rule was published in the Federal Register and required all unlined impoundments to initiate closure as soon as technically feasible, but no later than April 11, 2021. Additionally, the rule amends certain reporting requirements and CCR website requirements. On November 12, 2020, Part B of the CCR Rule was published in the Federal Register and provided a process to determine if certain unlined impoundments with an alternative liner system may be sufficiently protective and therefore may continue to operate.\nDTE Electric submitted applications to the EPA that support continued use of all impoundments through their active lives. The forced closure date of April 11, 2021 was effectively delayed, pending the EPA completing review of the applications. On September 1, 2022, DTE Electric ceased receipt of CCR and non-CCR waste streams at the St. Clair power plant bottom ash basins and initiated closure. Therefore, DTE Electric withdrew the Part A rule demonstration for St. Clair, as it was no longer necessary for the EPA to issue an extension of the April 11, 2021 deadline to cease receipt of waste.\nOn January 25, 2023, DTE Electric received notice of the EPA's proposed denial of Part B applications. DTE Electric provided comments on April 10, 2023, in response to the proposed decision. DTE Electric has since implemented projects at the Belle River power plant to cease receipt of waste within any unlined CCR surface impoundments. Therefore, on September 21, 2023, DTE Electric withdrew the Part B applications for the Belle River power plant, leaving only the Part B application for the Monroe power plant fly ash basin pending final review by the EPA. If the EPA's final decision remains unchanged, DTE Electric does not expect the denied application to have a significant operational or financial impact; however, DTE Electric is continuing to review and analyze potential outcomes of this matter.\n On May 18, 2023, the EPA posted in the Federal Register a proposed rule to regulate legacy CCR surface impoundments and CCR management units. The rule proposes to expand the reach of the CCR rule to inactive electric generation sites and previously unregulated locations of CCR at a regulated facility. DTE Electric is currently evaluating the proposed rule. The financial impact of the proposed rule cannot be estimated until a final rule is issued, which is currently expected in mid-2024.\nAt the State level, legislation was signed in December 2018 and provides for further regulation of the CCR program in Michigan. Additionally, the statutory revision provides the basis of a CCR program that EGLE has submitted to the EPA for approval to fully regulate the CCR program in Michigan in lieu of a Federal permit program. The EPA is currently working with EGLE in reviewing the submitted State program, and DTE Electric will work with EGLE to implement the State program that may be approved in the future.\nOn October 13, 2020, the EPA finalized the ELG Reconsideration Rule which revised the regulations from the 2015 ELG rule for FGD wastewater and bottom ash transport water only. The Reconsideration Rule re-established the technology-based effluent limitations guidelines and standards applicable to FGD wastewater and bottom ash transport water. The EPA set the applicability dates for bottom ash transport water \"as soon as possible\" beginning October 13, 2021 and no later than December 31, 2025. FGD wastewater retrofits must be completed \"as soon as possible\" beginning October 13, 2021 and no later than December 31, 2025 or December 31, 2028 if a permittee decides to pursue the Voluntary Incentives Program (VIP) subcategory for FGD wastewater. If a facility applies for the VIP, they must meet more stringent standards, but are allowed an extended time period to meet the compliance requirements.\nThe Reconsideration Rule also provides additional compliance opportunities by finalizing low utilization and cessation of coal burning subcategories. The Reconsideration Rule provides new opportunities for DTE Electric to evaluate existing ELG compliance strategies and make any necessary adjustments to ensure full compliance with the ELGs in a cost-effective manner.\nCompliance schedules for individual facilities and individual waste streams are determined through issuance of new NPDES permits by the State of Michigan. The State of Michigan has issued an NPDES permit for the Belle River power plant establishing compliance deadlines based on the 2020 Reconsideration Rule. On October 11, 2021, in consideration of the deadlines above, DTE Electric submitted a Notice of Planned Participation (\"NOPP\") to the State of Michigan that formally announced the intent to pursue compliance subcategories as ELG compliance options: the cessation of coal at the Belle River power plant no later than December 31, 2028 and the VIP for FGD wastewater at Monroe power plant by December 31, 2028.\nOn March 29, 2023, the EPA published two draft proposals to revise existing ELG rules. The first draft proposal reopened the cessation of coal compliance subcategory from the 2020 ELG rule and allows for compliance by committing to such cessation no later than December 31, 2028. This proposal was finalized by the EPA on May 30, 2023. The second draft proposal is a broader update to the ELG rules that includes revised compliance standards for FGD wastewater, bottom ash transport water, and other wastewater streams with a compliance date no later than December 31, 2029. DTE Electric's compliance strategy includes the conversion of the two generating units at the Belle River power plant to a natural gas peaking resource in 2025-2026, which was included in the NOPP filed in 2021. DTE Electric also submitted a new NOPP to apply for the cessation of coal compliance subcategory for generating units 3 and 4 at the Monroe power plant. DTE Electric plans to retire Monroe's generating units 1 and 2 in 2032.\nDTE Electric continues to evaluate compliance strategies, technologies, and system designs to achieve compliance with the EPA rules at the Monroe power plant.\nDTE Electric currently estimates the impact of the CCR and ELG rules to be $427 million of capital expenditures, including $417 million for 2024 through 2028. This estimate may change in future periods as DTE Electric evaluates the CCR and ELG rules discussed above that are expected to be finalized in mid-2024.\nDTE Gas\nContaminated and Other Sites — DTE Gas owns or previously owned 14 former MGP sites. Investigations have revealed contamination related to the by-products of gas manufacturing at each site. Cleanup of eight MGP sites is complete and those sites are closed. DTE Gas has also completed partial closure of four additional sites. Cleanup activities associated with the remaining sites will continue over the next several years. The MPSC has established a cost deferral and rate recovery mechanism for investigation and remediation costs incurred at former MGP sites. In addition to the MGP sites, DTE Gas is also in the process of cleaning up other contaminated sites, including gate stations, gas pipeline releases, and underground storage tank locations. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, DTE Gas had $26 million and $23 million, respectively, accrued for remediation. These costs are not discounted to their present value. Any change in assumptions, such as remediation techniques, nature and extent of contamination, and regulatory requirements, could impact the estimate of remedial action costs for the sites and affect DTE Gas' financial position and cash flows. DTE Gas anticipates the cost amortization methodology approved by the MPSC, which allows for amortization of the MGP costs over a ten-year period beginning with the year subsequent to the year the MGP costs were incurred, will prevent the associated investigation and remediation costs from having a material adverse impact on DTE Gas' results of operations.\nAir — The EPA recently finalized its Good Neighbor Rule, which includes provisions for compressor engines operated for the transportation of natural gas. DTE Gas is assessing the applicability of the rule on its engines and what impacts that could have on operations. DTE Gas has not determined whether there will be a financial impact at this time.\nNon-utility\nDTE Energy's non-utility businesses are subject to a number of environmental laws and regulations dealing with the protection of the environment from various pollutants.\nIn March 2019, the EPA issued an FOV to EES Coke Battery, LLC (\"EES Coke\"), the Michigan coke battery facility that is a wholly-owned subsidiary of DTE Energy, alleging that the 2008 and 2014 permits issued by EGLE did not comply with the Clean Air Act. In September 2020, the EPA issued another FOV alleging EES Coke's 2018 and 2019 SO2 emissions exceeded projections and hence violated non-attainment new source review permitting requirements. EES Coke evaluated the EPA's alleged violations and believes that the permits approved by EGLE complied with the Clean Air Act. EES Coke responded to the EPA's September 2020 allegations demonstrating its actual emissions are compliant with non-attainment new source review requirements. On June 1, 2022, the U.S. Department of Justice, on behalf of the EPA, filed a complaint against EES Coke in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan alleging that EES Coke failed to comply with non-attainment new source review requirements under the Clean Air Act when it applied for the 2014 permit. In November 2022, the Sierra Club and City of River Rouge were granted intervention. The case is currently in the discovery phase. At the present time, DTE Energy cannot predict the outcome or financial impact of this matter.\nSeparately, in December 2021, EGLE issued a Notice of Violation to EES Coke alleging excess visible emissions from pushing operations. In January 2022, EES Coke provided EGLE a response describing the corrective actions taken to prevent future recurrences. At the present time, EES Coke cannot predict the outcome or financial impact of this matter.\nOther\nIn 2010, the EPA finalized a new one-hour SO2 ambient air quality standard that requires states to submit plans and associated timelines for non-attainment areas that demonstrate attainment with the new SO2 standard in phases. Phase 1 addresses non-attainment areas designated based on ambient monitoring data. Phase 2 addresses non-attainment areas with large sources of SO2 and modeled concentrations exceeding the National Ambient Air Quality Standards for SO2. Phase 3 addresses smaller sources of SO2 with modeled or monitored exceedances of the new SO2 standard.\nMichigan's Phase 1 non-attainment area includes DTE Energy facilities. However, the EPA published a Federal Implementation Plan (FIP) for the area in June 2022 that did not impact any DTE Energy facilities. It is also not expected that Phase 3 will have any impact on DTE Energy.\nMichigan's Phase 2 non-attainment area includes DTE Electric facilities in St. Clair County. The EPA approved a clean data determination request submitted by EGLE. This determination suspends certain planning requirements and sanctions for the non-attainment area for as long as the area continues to attain the 2010 SO2 air quality standards, but this does not automatically redesignate the area to attainment. Until the area is officially redesignated as attainment, DTE Energy is unable to determine the impacts."

In the non‐utility segment, DTE Energy (through EES Coke) has responded to allegations regarding compliance with the Clean Air Act by evaluating its permits and taking corrective actions where needed. However, the company explicitly states that it is unable to predict the outcome or the financial impact of the current legal matters. This suggests that, while DTE Energy is engaged in addressing regulatory enforcement and has provided responses to environmental allegations, a detailed strategy (for example, risk management frameworks including proactive compliance programs, reserves for legal contingencies, or strategies to limit exposure to future litigation) is not explicitly described in the provided text.\n\nIn terms of the impact on long‑term growth prospects and investor returns, the uncertainty surrounding regulatory outcomes and potential litigation means that any adverse results (such as settlements, fines, or required operational modifications) could result in unplanned costs or capital diversion. Such outcomes might negatively affect profitability and cash flows, thereby influencing long‑term growth and investor returns. Conversely, if DTE Energy’s responses and compliance measures limit legal exposure and demonstrate proactive risk management, then any negative financial impact could be mitigated over time. However, due to the inherent uncertainty noted by the company—the inability to predict outcomes or estimate financial impacts—the exact degree to which these legal risks will affect long‑term performance and returns remains indeterminate at this time."

        "The pharmaceutical industry is highly competitive. We face competition from other pharmaceutical manufacturers globally, some of whom are significantly larger than us and have stronger, more well-established reputations than us. Our competitors may be able to develop products and processes competitive with or superior to our own for many reasons, including but not limited to the possibility that they may have:\n•proprietary processes or delivery systems;\n•larger or more productive R&D and marketing staff;\n•larger or more efficient production capabilities in a particular therapeutic area;\n•more experience in preclinical testing and human clinical trials;\n•more products;\n•more experience in developing new drugs; or\n•greater financial resources.\n\nWe also face increasing competition from lower-cost generic products and other branded products, including our ARV products. Many of our products are not protected by patent rights or have limited patent life and will soon lose patent protection. Loss of patent protection for a product typically is followed promptly with the launch of generic products. As a result, sales of many of these products may decline or stop growing over time, and may decline faster than has been projected. For example, Perforomist® lost exclusivity and experienced generic competition in June 2021, and Lyrica’s pediatric exclusivity expired in Japan in July 2022. In addition, Amitiza®, which we commercialize as a patent licensee, may experience generic competition in Japan prior to the expiration of certain patent term extensions. We may not be successful in managing competition from non-branded generics or other alternatives, or in generally managing revenues after loss of exclusivity, and our business may be materially adversely affected.\n\nGeneric competitors are also becoming more aggressive in terms of pricing in many of the regions in which Viatris operates. In China, for example, we face strong competition from certain generic manufacturers, which have resulted and may in the future result in price cuts and volume loss on some of Viatris’ branded products. In many emerging markets, we face increased competition and contracting markets for certain of our ARV products, primarily related to competing therapies. We also face competition in the United States, the EU and other mature markets that have a robust generics market and favorable regulatory conditions for generics. In addition, legislative proposals emerge from time to time in various jurisdictions to further encourage the early and rapid approval of generic drugs. Any such proposal that is enacted into law could increase competition and worsen this negative effect on our branded sales.\n\nIn addition, certain of our products also face potential competition from products that may be developed in the future that could render our products uncompetitive or obsolete. For example, Viatris or other companies may develop medicines that treat the same indications targeted by our current products, and these medicines could be more effective than our current products or patients and physicians could prefer these medicines over our current medicines. The introduction of these new competing products could also have a negative impact on product sales.\nOther related factors that could affect our business include:\n•Competitors’ products may be safer, more effective, more effectively marketed or sold, or have lower prices or better performance features than ours;\n•PBMs and other pharmaceutical manufacturers may utilize contracting strategies that could decrease utilization of or otherwise negatively impact our products;\n•Vertical integration of pharmacies and large purchasing organizations or consolidation among distribution outlets; and\n•Our sales have suffered and may suffer in the future as a result of changes in consumer demand for our products, including those related to fluctuations in consumer buying patterns tied to seasonality or other factors, willingness of\ncustomers to switch among products of different pharmaceutical manufacturers, importation by consumers or the introduction of new products by competitors.\n\nThe occurrence of any of the above risks could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, ability to pay dividends and/or stock price."

      "ground_truth": "The data provided allows us to assess several key financing items and compare their impact on liquidity and the cash position in 2023 versus prior years. In 2023, Kimco’s financing activities included (a) principal debt repayments, (b) unsecured note transactions, and (c) dividend distributions, and here is a breakdown:\n\n1. Principal Debt Repayments: \n   • 2023: Kimco paid $49.5 million on debt (excluding normal amortization) plus $11.3 million for rental property debt, totaling about $60.8 million in debt repayments. \n   • 2022: The similar items added up to roughly $167.7 million in principal repayments ($157.9 million non-rental and $9.8 million rental). \n   • 2021: The total was around $239.9 million ($229.3 million non-rental + $10.6 million rental). \n   In 2023, considerably lower debt repayments helped conserve cash compared to earlier years.\n\n2. Unsecured Note Transactions:\n   • 2023: Kimco reported proceeds of $500 million from the issuance of unsecured notes, with no reported repayments for that year. \n   • 2022: Despite a $1.25 billion issuance, there was also a large repayment of unsecured notes (approximately $1.45 billion), resulting in a net cash outflow that significantly contributed to a more negative financing cash flow. \n   • 2021: Proceeds of $500 million were recorded. \n   In 2023, by not having a large note repayment, the net effect of unsecured note transactions was more favorable, avoiding the heavy cash outflow seen in 2022.\n\n3. Dividend Distributions:\n   • 2023: Dividends paid were about $657.5 million, \n   • 2022: Dividends were approximately $544.7 million, and\n   • 2021: Approximately $382.1 million in dividends were paid.\n   Although dividends in 2023 represent a substantial cash outflow and increased compared to prior years, the reduction in other financing outflows (notably lower debt repayments and the absence of large note repayments) helped offset this.\n\n4. Overall Impact on Liquidity and Cash Position:\n   • Net cash flow from financing activities in 2023 was a negative $300.7 million, which is a much smaller cash outflow compared with 2022’s negative $982.7 million and somewhat more negative than 2021’s negative $101.1 million.\n   • These changes contributed to the overall cash position: Kimco ended 2023 with cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash of approximately $783.8 million – a significant rebound especially when compared to the end-of-year cash of $149.8 million in 2022 and $334.7 million in 2021.\n\nSummary: In 2023, while dividend payments increased relative to previous years, the company substantially reduced its cash outflow from financing by making lower principal debt repayments and not incurring large unsecured note repayments. As a result, despite using significant cash for dividends, these financing activities contributed to an overall stronger liquidity position and an improved cash balance in 2023 compared to the prior periods."

Saville, is 68 years old, which suggests he has an extensive background and institutional knowledge from his long career. This age and his position indicate he likely serves as a mentor figure and an anchor for the company’s governance.\n\nIn contrast, the President and CEO (Eugene J. Bredow) along with the Senior Vice President/Chief Financial Officer (Daniel D. Malzahn) are both 54 years old. Being in their mid-50s suggests that they have significant experience; however, they also potentially have several years left in active leadership roles. This age bracket provides a good balance between seasoned expertise and the potential for continued growth or a future transition into even higher leadership positions.\n\nAdditionally, Matthew B. Kelpy, the Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer, is 50 years old, which indicates that there is a mix of both mid- and senior-level professionals. The younger age could imply that he might be considered a candidate for future roles as part of the company's succession planning strategy.\n\nOverall, the age distribution among top executives at NVR, Inc. suggests that the company likely emphasizes both experienced oversight and long-term succession planning. With a seasoned Executive Chairman providing stability and a younger executive team in operational roles, NVR appears to manage its leadership pipeline in a manner that supports both current performance and future leadership continuity."

This diversity can influence the company’s strategic decision-making in several key ways:\n\n1. Comprehensive Risk Management and Due Diligence: With board members who have deep experience in finance, accounting, and law, the board is more likely to thoroughly evaluate risks, regulatory compliance and financial assessments in strategic initiatives. This aids robust risk management practices by ensuring that potential downsides are well identified and managed.\n\n2. Holistic Strategic Oversight: The presence of directors with operational and executive experience (e.g., the CEO and CFO) together with those well-versed in specialized areas (such as accounting and legal expertise) fosters a multi-perspective review of strategic alternatives. Such comprehensive oversight supports more informed, balanced, and resilient strategic decisions that can enhance long-term profitability.\n\n3. Enhanced Board Dynamics and Innovation: A varied skill set among board members promotes diversity of thought. This encourages creative problem solving and innovation in capital allocation, cost management, and market positioning, potentially leading to improved competitive positioning and growth.\n\n4. Governance and Stakeholder Confidence: Diverse expertise can increase investor and stakeholder confidence in the board’s capability to steer the company through complex market conditions. Strong governance practices, underpinned by varied expertise, can translate into a more stable environment conducive to long-term financial performance.\n\nOverall, the mix of skills present on the board—ranging from financial oversight to operational and legal expertise—enables Welltower Inc. to better assess strategic risks and opportunities and to adapt its strategy to changing market dynamics.

The primary drivers of the outflow were $115 million of capital expenditures and $46 million of acquisitions of businesses and intangible assets, which were partially offset by $65 million of net cash receipts from the settlement of derivative instruments and $61 million of net proceeds from the sale of our business in Russia.

      "ground_truth": "In 2023, Otis reported a net cash outflow from investing activities of $183 million. This outflow was primarily driven by three components: (1) Capital Expenditures of $138 million, which represents investments in long-term assets to support and modernize the company’s operations; (2) Acquisitions of businesses and intangible assets amounting to $36 million, indicating strategic growth through expanding capabilities or market presence; and (3) Net cash payments of $28 million related to the settlement of derivative instruments, reflecting the costs associated with risk management activities (such as hedging against fluctuations in interest rates, foreign exchange, or commodity prices).\n\nThe $183 million total outflow suggests that Otis is deliberately allocating substantial resources to bolster its long-term asset base and strategic positioning. The heavy emphasis on capital expenditures underpins a commitment to maintaining and upgrading core operational infrastructure, while the investments in acquisitions signal a proactive approach to driving organic and inorganic growth. The inclusion of derivative settlements in this breakdown also highlights that risk management is integrated into the company’s overall investment strategy. Overall, the financial outflow reinforces an investment strategy that balances the need for operational enhancement, strategic expansion, and effective risk mitigation."

      "ground_truth": "To assess the net profit margin for each year, we first calculate it by dividing net income by revenues. Based on the provided figures:\n\n• 2021: Net income = $784.8 million, Revenue = $1,327.6 million → Margin = 784.8/1327.6 ≈ 59.1%\n• 2022: Net income = $673.8 million, Revenue = $1,424.9 million → Margin = 673.8/1424.9 ≈ 47.3%\n• 2023: Net income = $817.6 million, Revenue = $1,493.1 million → Margin = 817.6/1493.1 ≈ 54.8%\n\nThe net profit margin is a bottom‐line measure, which naturally reflects the impact of items that occur after operating income—including interest expenses, non‐operating income (or losses), and tax effects. In the operating income calculations, the company was profitable and largely consistent, but the following items then modified this performance:\n\n1. Interest Expense: This is subtracted from operating income in all years. For example, while the interest expense remained relatively stable (around $75–83 million), it represents a fixed cost drain regardless of operating success. Its effect is constant and contributes to reducing net income relative to operating income.\n\n2. Non-Operating Income: The impact from non-operating items has varied significantly. In 2021, a small loss (-$1.3 million) had almost no positive effect, whereas in 2022, a positive contribution of $12.4 million helped to partially offset expenses. Most notably, in 2023 non-operating income was much higher at $51.2 million, which substantially boosted net income.\n\n3. Tax Effects: Another important factor is the tax expense (or benefit). For example, in 2021 the slight tax benefit (+$2.6 million) and in 2022 a much larger tax expense (around $206.4 million) further widened the differences in net income across the years, while in 2023 the tax expense was lower ($158.9 million).\n\nWhat these observations show over the three-year period: \n\n• Between 2021 (margin ~59.1%) and 2022 (margin ~47.3%), the net margin fell significantly. This decline does not appear to be driven by a deterioration in operating income (which increased from $866.8 to $943.1 million) but rather by higher net expenses beyond operations (particularly the tax impact and absence of strong non-operating gains in 2021, compared to a small positive in 2022).\n\n• In 2023, while revenues and operating income grew, the net margin improved to approximately 54.8%. This improvement is largely attributable to the substantial rise in non-operating income ($51.2 million), which more than offset the continuing interest expense and partly mitigated tax costs. \n\nThus, the net profit margin neatly encapsulates the extent to which non-operating items—as well as interest and tax expenses—affect the bottom line. It highlights that even when operating performance is strong or improving, secondary factors like non-operating income and tax circumstances can lead to notable fluctuations in net profitability over time."

      "ground_truth": "The provided data does offer enough detail to examine how Celanese is turning its capital investments into operating profit across its segments by comparing the operating profit figures with the corresponding capital expenditures over the past three years. For example, looking at the consolidated numbers:\n\n• In 2021, the consolidated operating profit was US$1,946 million with capital expenditures of US$490 million, implying roughly US$3.97 of operating profit per US$1 invested in CAPEX.\n• In 2022 the consolidated operating profit was US$1,378 million with CAPEX of US$583 million – that is, about US$2.36 profit per US$1 of CAPEX.\n• In 2023, the consolidated figures show operating profit of US$1,687 million against CAPEX of US$542 million, which is approximately US$3.11 generated for every US$1 of investment.\n\nThese ratios indicate that while there was a dip in 2022, overall, the conversion of capital expenditures into operating performance has been generally robust, although there is some volatility from year to year.\n\nSegment‐by‐segment, the data also provide insights:\n\n1. Engineered Materials: \n   • 2021: Operating profit of US$411 million with CAPEX of US$154 million gives an approximate ratio of 2.67.\n   • 2022: US$429 million operating profit with US$178 million in CAPEX yields about 2.41.\n   • 2023: US$1,083 million operating profit with US$237 million in CAPEX improves this ratio to approximately 4.57. \n   This suggests that at least in the Engineered Materials segment, recent capital spending is paying off significantly better than in prior years.\n\n2. Acetyl Chain: (Note that for this segment there is a reference to an adjusted gain from the joint venture formation that affects the operating profit numbers.)\n   • 2021: Operating profit of about US$1,875 million with CAPEX of US$311 million gives roughly 6.03.\n   • 2022: US$1,447 million operating profit with US$352 million in CAPEX gives around 4.11.\n   • 2023: US$1,109 million operating profit paired with US$207 million in CAPEX results in a ratio of about 5.36.\n   Here, while the 2021 ratio was the highest, the 2023 ratio has partially rebounded compared to 2022, indicating that the capital investment efficiency in the Acetyl Chain segment has experienced some fluctuation, possibly due to one‐time adjustments (such as the joint venture gain).\n\n3. Other Activities: \n   Although these have registered operating losses, the loss per dollar invested has narrowed over time:\n   • In 2021, a loss of US$340 vs CAPEX of US$25 results in a very high (negative) ratio (~–13.6).\n   • In 2022, a loss of US$498 with US$53 in CAPEX (approx. –9.40).\n   • In 2023, a loss of US$505 against US$98 in CAPEX yields about –5.16.\n   This trend suggests that, despite negative operating performance, the efficiency of the capital conversion (in absolute terms) is improving in this segment.\n\nIn summary, the data indicate that Celanese has been moderately effective in converting capital expenditures into operating profit. The Engineered Materials segment in particular shows a notable improvement in 2023, while Acetyl Chain has experienced some fluctuations. Overall, the consolidated ratio improved from 2022 to 2023 despite the variations in segment performance, which suggests that capital allocation has contributed positively to operational efficiency and profitability. However, the year‐to‐year volatility and the impact of nonrecurring items (such as the joint venture gains and elimination adjustments) imply that a more detailed breakdown would be needed to fully assess the sustainability of these returns."

        "We recognize the importance of identifying, assessing, and managing material risks associated with cybersecurity threats. These risks include, among other things: operational risks; intellectual property theft; fraud; extortion; harm to employees or customers; violation of privacy or security laws and other litigation and legal risks; and reputational risks. Our process for identifying and assessing material risks from cybersecurity threats operates in conjunction with our overall risk management systems and processes, covering all company risks.\nOur cybersecurity risk management program is led by our Chief Information Security Officer (“CISO”), who manages our security team and is principally responsible for our cybersecurity risk assessment processes, our security controls, and our detection and response to cybersecurity incidents. Our program includes protocols for preventing, monitoring, detecting and responding to cybersecurity events and incidents, and cross-functional coordination and governance of business continuity and disaster recovery plans. Components of our program include:\n•risk assessments designed to help identify cybersecurity threats to our products and related supportive infrastructure, critical IT systems, information, and our broader enterprise IT environment;\n•monitoring, detection and collection and analysis of information regarding evolving, ongoing, and emerging threats and vulnerabilities, and corresponding actions to assess and remediate corresponding risks;\n•regular testing and assessments to identify vulnerabilities;\n•the periodic engagement of independent security firms and other third-party experts, where appropriate, to assess, test, and certify components of our cybersecurity program, and to otherwise assist with aspects of our cybersecurity processes and controls;\n•annual cybersecurity awareness training for our employees;\n•regular assessments of the design and operational effectiveness of the program’s key processes and controls by our internal audit team as well as external consultants; and\n•a risk management process for third-party service providers and vendors that includes due diligence in the selection process and periodic monitoring regarding adherence to applicable cybersecurity standards.We also have a cybersecurity incident response plan to assess and manage cybersecurity incidents, which includes escalation procedures based on the nature and severity of the incident, including, where appropriate, escalation to the Risk Committee and the Board. We periodically perform tabletop exercises to test our incident response procedures, identify gaps and improvement opportunities, and assess team preparedness.\nAs part of our overall risk mitigation strategy, we maintain insurance coverage that is intended to address certain aspects of cybersecurity risks; however, such insurance may not be sufficient in type or amount to cover us against claims related to cybersecurity breaches, cyberattacks and other related breaches. We periodically review our cybersecurity insurance program.\nAs of the date of this report, we do not believe that any risks from cybersecurity threats, including as a result of any previous cybersecurity incidents, have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our Company, including our business strategy, results of operations or financial condition. Despite our security measures, however, there can be no assurance that we, or third parties with whom we interact, will not experience a cybersecurity incident in the future that will materially affect us. For more information on our cybersecurity related risks, see Part I, Item 1A. “Risk Factors,” including “Security vulnerabilities or control failures in our IT infrastructure or multicloud application security and delivery products and services as well as unforeseen product errors could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and reputation.”\nGovernance\nOur Board of Directors is actively involved in overseeing risks from cybersecurity threats and is assisted in that oversight by its Risk Committee. The Risk Committee reviews and assesses the Company’s cybersecurity risk exposure and evaluates the adequacy and effectiveness of related risk management processes and policies.\nAs part of the oversight process, the Risk Committee has the following responsibilities, among others:\n•reviews and advises on our cybersecurity and operational risk strategy, resiliency, crisis and incident management, and security-related information technology planning processes, and reviews strategy and implementation for investing in related systems, controls, and procedures with management;\n•reviews our compliance with applicable global data protection and security laws and regulations, and the Company’s adoption and implementation of systems, controls and procedures designed to comply with such laws and regulations;\n•reviews plans for periodic assessments and related findings and remediation of our cybersecurity and operational risk and incident response and disaster recovery programs by outside professionals;\n•reviews analyses of our cybersecurity and operational risks by management and third parties, as applicable; and\n•evaluates our disclosure controls and procedures related to cybersecurity to ensure timely and accurate reporting of cybersecurity and operational risks and incidents, as appropriate.\nThe Risk Committee meets at least four times a year and regularly reports to the full Board, including regarding its review and assessment of cybersecurity risk oversight matters and related recommendations. The Board of Directors discusses our programs and policies related to cybersecurity and risk initiatives and considers them closely both from a risk management perspective and as part of F5’s business strategy.\nThe Risk Committee receives periodic updates from our CISO, and other persons the Risk Committee deems appropriate, on a range of cybersecurity matters, including those referenced above as well as on the status of the Company’s cybersecurity posture and risk mitigation efforts. If cyber-related issues arise between Risk Committee meetings that the CISO believes could have a material adverse impact on the Company, the CISO, or another appropriate risk management leader, will report to the Chair of the Risk Committee.\nAt the management level, our CISO leads our enterprise-wide cybersecurity program in partnership with other business leaders, including our General Counsel and Chief Operating Officer. These members of management are informed about and monitor the prevention, mitigation, detection, and remediation of cybersecurity incidents through their management of, and participation in, the cybersecurity risk management and strategy processes described above. In December 2023, our CISO retired after three years in the position, and a career spanning over twenty-five years as an industry-recognized leader in cybersecurity, information technology, and risk management. Her replacement has served in various roles in information technology, security and risk management for over 15 years, including having previously served as the CISO of two other publicly traded technology companies. In September 2024, our current CISO began transitioning to a new role within the Company, and as a result, we have appointed an interim CISO while we conduct a search for his permanent replacement. Our interim CISO has over 25 years of experience in technology and information security operations across a diverse range of business sectors."

First, by embedding cybersecurity processes into a broader risk management framework, the company enhances its ability to identify, assess, and mitigate various cyber threats in tandem with other operational risks. This integration allows for a more comprehensive view of the risk landscape, which can lead to a more resilient operational environment by:\n\n•   Improving early detection and response to cybersecurity incidents: The combined risk management process ensures that vulnerabilities in IT systems, both cybersecurity and broader operational issues, are monitored continuously. This proactive detection may lower the chance of a material disruption, thereby reducing unplanned costs and liabilities.\n\n•   Enhancing overall risk governance: The oversight provided by the Board’s Risk Committee and the routine involvement of the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) ensure regular updates and stringent testing of risk controls. This level of oversight can contribute to smoother operational execution and maintain investor confidence, which is crucial from a financial perspective.\n\n•   Streamlining risk mitigation efforts: With integrated assessments and third-party evaluations, F5, Inc. is positioned to timely reinforce its security protocols. Improved control over risks means a potentially lower frequency and severity of incidents that could have financial consequences, thereby supporting stable or predictable financial performance.\n\nWhile there are no direct numerical calculations provided in the reference, this integrated risk management approach typically results in lower operating disruptions, potentially lower insurance premiums in the long-term, and a more favorable perception by stakeholders. In summary, by aligning cybersecurity risk management with its overall risk systems, F5, Inc. is likely to enhance its operational stability and mitigate financial impacts from cybersecurity incidents, which in turn can contribute to a more robust financial performance in the long run."

The combined figure implies that future cash flows will be significantly affected by the need to meet both interest expenses—which impact operating expenses and potentially net income—and principal repayments—which reduce the outstanding debt balance and affect the company’s leverage and liquidity. For a more detailed analysis on the mix and timing of these payments (for instance, to term out interest vs. principal impacts on cash flow statements), additional contractual details or segment-specific data would be required. In summary, while we can comment on the overall aggregate cash impact, the exact mix and its detailed implications on the cash flows remain indeterminate with the current data."

Brand and Financial Strength: By leveraging strong brand recognition, superior customer trust, and robust financial ratings, Allstate reinforces the quality and reliability of its offerings in a competitive environment. \n\n3. Distribution and Customer Service Excellence: An extensive distribution network and a focus on exemplary customer service enable Allstate to offer personalized coverage solutions, ensuring that their product offerings are not merely commodity offerings bundled for price discounts. \n\nIn summary, while competitors may rely on bundling core insurance products with voluntary benefits at discounted rates, Allstate maintains a competitive edge by delivering specialized, customer-centric products backed by strong financial credentials, a wide-reaching distribution system, and exceptional service.

Payments are estimated for variable rate and variable term debt based on effective interest rates at September 28, 2024, and expected payment dates.\n(3)Amounts include guarantees of obligations related to certain outside third parties, which consist of leases, debt and livestock grower loans, all of which are substantially collateralized by the underlying assets, as well as residual value guarantees covering certain operating leases for various types of equipment. The amounts included are the maximum potential amount of future payments.\n(4)For additional information regarding operating leases, refer to Part II, Item 8, Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 6: Leases.\n(5)Amounts include agreements with a remaining term in excess of one year to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The purchase obligations amount included items, such as future purchase commitments for grains and livestock purchase contracts, that provide terms that meet the above criteria. For certain grain purchase commitments with a fixed quantity provision, we have assumed the future obligations under the commitment based on available commodity futures prices as published in observable active markets as of September 28, 2024. We have excluded future purchase commitments for contracts that do not meet these criteria. Purchase orders are not included in the table, as a purchase order is an authorization to purchase and is cancellable. Contracts for goods or services that contain termination clauses without penalty have also been excluded.\n(6)Amounts include estimated amounts to complete buildings and equipment under construction as of September 28, 2024.\n(7)Other long-term liabilities primarily consist of deferred compensation, deferred income, self-insurance and asset retirement obligations. We are unable to reliably estimate the amount and timing of the remaining payments beyond fiscal 2024; therefore, we have only included the total liability in the table above. We also have employee benefit obligations consisting of pensions and other postretirement benefits of $180 million that are excluded from the table above. A discussion of the Company's pension and postretirement plans, including funding matters, is included in Part II, Item 8, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 15: Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits.\nIn addition to the amounts shown above in the table, we have unrecognized tax benefits of $137 million and related interest and penalties of $59 million at September 28, 2024, recorded in Other long-term liabilities.\nThe potential maximum contractual obligation associated with our cash flow assistance programs at September 28, 2024, based on the estimated fair values of the livestock supplier’s net tangible assets on that date, aggregated to approximately $280 million.

In 2025, Tyson Foods must fulfill obligations totaling $1,778 million. These include:\n\n• Debt principal payments: $75 million\n• Interest payments: $489 million\n• Guarantees: $24 million\n• Operating lease obligations: $197 million\n• Purchase obligations: $368 million\n• Capital expenditures: $625 million\n\nIn contrast, the company’s obligations for later periods are considerably higher. For example:\n\n• 2026–2027: $4,512 million\n• 2028–2029: $3,374 million\n• 2030 and thereafter: $7,713 million\n\nTotal contractual commitments across all periods amount to $18,281 million. The short-term (2025) commitments represent roughly 10% of this overall total.\n\nThis structure implies that while the immediate contractual cash outlays for 2025 are relatively modest compared to the larger medium- and long-term obligations, they still require the company to maintain adequate near-term liquidity. In other words, Tyson Foods faces a lower immediate liquidity burden but must ensure that its operating cash flows and liquidity management are robust enough to cover the 2025 commitments without stress. The larger, deferred obligations will need to be managed over time through refinancing, cash flow planning, and capital allocation strategies, but for near-term risk, the focus is on ensuring that the $1.78 billion due in 2025 can be met without compromising ongoing operations."

      "ground_truth": "The data shows that TransDigm has been steadily increasing its capex over the three fiscal periods—from a total of $119 million in 2022 to $165 million in 2024—while depreciation and amortization have also grown (from $253 million in 2022 to $312 million in 2024). This suggests a couple of key insights:\n\n1. Consistent Investment in Core Assets: The upward trend in capital expenditures, particularly in the Power & Control and Airframe segments, indicates that TransDigm is reinvesting in its critical operational assets. This ongoing investment is crucial not only for maintaining the current asset base but also for positioning the company for future growth.\n\n2. Balance between Replacement and Growth: The relatively stable ratio of capital expenditures to depreciation (roughly in the 0.47–0.53 range over the years) implies that the company is investing enough to both replace aging assets and expand its operational capacity. In other words, while depreciation reflects the historical capital intensity of its operations, the increased capex signals that TransDigm is actively modernizing its asset base, which bodes well for sustaining future earnings and competitive positioning.\n\n3. Strategic Focus on High-Margin Segments: The more pronounced increases in spending in the Power & Control and Airframe segments suggest that TransDigm is concentrating its resources where demand might be higher or where margins are better. This approach is typically associated with future growth potential, especially if these segments are positioned well in their respective markets.\n\nOverall, the data supports the view that TransDigm is strategically managing its operational assets through disciplined capital allocation. The pattern of investment not only maintains its asset base through replacement (as mirrored by the depreciation levels) but also fuels future growth by expanding capabilities in its key business segments."

It also provides for maintenance of buildings, facilities and equipment and replacement of certain aircraft within our fleet. We currently expect our capital expenditures will be approximately $4.5 billion in 2024, of which approximately 50 percent will be allocated to network enhancement projects and other technology initiatives.\nTotal capital expenditures increased in 2023 compared to 2022 as a result of:\n•Spending on buildings, facilities and plant equipment increased due to network enhancements, capacity expansion projects and facility maintenance.\n•Vehicles expenditures increased, driven by the timing and availability of vehicle replacements and continuing investments in our network.\n•Information technology expenditures increased as a result of continuing investments in our digital capabilities and network automation.\n•Aircraft expenditures decreased as a result of lower payments on open aircraft orders and final delivery of aircraft.\nProceeds from the disposal of businesses, property, plant and equipment were higher in 2023 relative to 2022, primarily due to the sale of surplus real estate during 2023.\nNet purchases of marketable securities increased in 2023 due to a shift to longer duration investments.

Since no single customer accounts for a significant share of overall sales, the company reduces its dependence on the success or failure of any one client. This diversification helps to attenuate the impact of potential downturns in a particular sector or the loss of a major customer. In a competitive market environment where fluctuations in supply, demand and competitive pressures are always present, having a broad range of customers spreads exposure across multiple markets and industries. This not only hedges against risk but also supports stable revenue growth by allowing the company to leverage different market opportunities and offset declines in one region or product line with gains in another. Thus, the wide-reaching customer base enhances resilience and positions DuPont to sustain predictable revenue streams even amid competitive and economic changes."

These roles are pivotal because they oversee financial reporting, manage internal controls, and address risk management policies. Their presence on the board suggests that The Home Depot, Inc. is committed to ensuring a high quality of financial integrity and robust internal controls.

        "Our primary ongoing cash requirements are to fund our existing operations, store expansion and improvement, CAF and strategic growth initiatives. Since fiscal 2013, we have also elected to use cash for our share repurchase program.  Our primary ongoing sources of liquidity include funds provided by operations, proceeds from non-recourse funding vehicles and borrowings under our revolving credit facility or through other financing sources.\nOur current capital allocation strategy is to focus on our core business. Given our recent performance and continued market uncertainties, we are taking a conservative approach to our capital structure in order to maintain the flexibility that allows us to efficiently access the capital markets for both CAF and CarMax as a whole. We have taken steps to better align our expenses to sales as well as slowed the rate of our store growth. We resumed our share repurchases during the third quarter of fiscal 2024 after a pause initiated during the third quarter of the prior fiscal year. For fiscal 2025, we intend to modestly accelerate the pace of our share repurchases above the pace that we implemented in the third quarter of fiscal 2024. We believe we have the appropriate liquidity, access to capital and financial strength to support our operations and continue investing in our strategic initiatives for the next twelve months and thereafter for the foreseeable future.We are party to contractual obligations involving commitments to make payments to third parties. These obligations impact our liquidity and capital resource needs. Our contractual obligations primarily consist of long-term debt and related interest payments, leases, purchase obligations and commitments, income taxes and defined benefit retirement plans. See Notes 12 and 16 for amounts outstanding as of February 29, 2024 related to debt and leases, respectively.\nOur contractual obligations related to income taxes represent the net unrecognized tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions. See Note 10 for information related to income taxes. Our contractual obligations related to defined benefit retirement plans represent the funded status recognized as of February 29, 2024. See Note 11 for information related to these plans.\nPurchase obligations and commitments consist of certain enforceable and legally binding obligations related to real estate purchases, third-party outsourcing services and advertising. As of February 29, 2024, our purchase obligations and commitments were approximately $428.2 million, of which $213.3 million are due in fiscal 2025. The majority of the remaining purchase obligations and commitments are due within the next three years.\nWe have historically managed leverage based on a number of factors, including internal financial forecasts, consideration of CAF’s operational and capital needs, external peer benchmarking, requirements of our debt agreements and macroeconomic conditions. Generally, we expect to use our revolving credit facility and other financing sources, together with stock repurchases, to maintain a leverage profile that ensures operating flexibility while supporting continued investment in the business."

      "ground_truth": "PG&E’s balance sheet data allows us to analyze several components of its working capital. Notably, three items were highlighted:\n\n1. **Regulatory Balancing Accounts**: These have increased substantially from $3,264 million in 2022 to $5,660 million in 2023. Such an increase often reflects accounting adjustments related to timing differences or regulatory filings. While the higher balance may indicate that PG&E expects favorable rate adjustments or future recoveries, it also implies that a significant component of its working capital is tied up in regulatory mechanisms, which can be subject to regulatory review and uncertainty.\n\n2. **Customer Receivables**: The receivables (net of allowances) decreased from $2,645 million in 2022 to $2,048 million in 2023. A decline in outstanding receivables is usually a sign of more efficient cash collection and lower days sales outstanding, which improves liquidity and working capital efficiency.\n\n3. **Accrued Unbilled Revenue**: These slightly declined from $1,304 million to $1,254 million, suggesting that the accruals are tracking current revenue recognition closely without significant buildup. This moderation helps avoid an excessive build‐up of revenue that has not yet been billed, ultimately supporting a more reliable conversion into cash.\n\n**Overall Implications for Working Capital and Future Cash Flow Stability**:\n• The reduction in customer receivables combined with a modest decrease in accrued unbilled revenue indicates a better handle on working capital management. This efficient conversion of receivables to cash is positive for operating liquidity.\n• The notable increase in regulatory balancing accounts, while potentially a source of future cash inflows once adjustments are confirmed by regulators, also represents a regulatory risk. Should the anticipated recoveries or adjustments not materialize as expected, it might momentarily strain working capital.\n\nIn summary, PG&E appears to be managing its working capital well with its improved receivables and controlled accruals, which bodes well for future cash flow stability. However, the large regulatory balancing account warrants a cautious note; while it may signal future cash benefits, it remains subject to regulatory interpretation and timing uncertainties."

        "Overall, the specialty vehicle aftermarket parts and accessories market serves a fragmented customer base composed of RV, marine, and specialty automotive dealers, installers, jobbers, builders, parts chains, and mail-order businesses. Our customers are principally small, independent businesses. These customers depend on us to provide a broad range of products, rapid delivery, marketing support and technical assistance. In addition to traditional customers, we sell to several large parts and accessory online retailers. Our Specialty segment also operates retail stores in northeast Pennsylvania.\n\nWe promote our products to customers through marketing programs, which include: (i) catalogs, advertising, sponsorships and promotional activities, (ii) product level marketing and merchandising support, and (iii) online and digital marketing initiatives. We stage in-person and/or virtual trade shows across the U.S., which provide an opportunity to improve sales through the showcasing of new and innovative products from our vendors to our customers.\n\nOnline sales, which represent the majority of our sales, of our Specialty products take place primarily through our ekeystone.com, viantp.com, and SeaWideB2B.com sites and our mobile app. These sites provide customers (i) the ability to match products with the make and model of vehicle thus allowing the customer to order the correct part, (ii) product information (e.g., pictures, attributes) available for review and (iii) the convenience of searching inventory availability and ordering the product on the site. Additionally, these sites can provide sales opportunities by suggesting other parts to purchase based on an inquiry submitted by the customer.",
        "We consider all suppliers of vehicle collision and mechanical products to be competitors, including aftermarket suppliers, recycling businesses, refurbishing operations, parts remanufacturers, OEMs and internet-based suppliers. We compete with alternative parts distributors on the basis of our nationwide distribution system, our product lines and inventory availability, customer service, our relationships with insurance companies, and to a lesser extent, price; we compete with OEMs primarily on the basis of price and, to a lesser extent, on service and product quality. In the U.S., we do not consider retail chains that focus on the do-it-yourself market to be our direct competitors because many of our wholesale product sales are influenced byinsurance companies, who ultimately pay for the repair costs of insured vehicles in excess of any deductible amount, rather than the end user, and there is limited overlap in the products that we sell."

Generating Sales: They form the backbone for online sales, which represent the majority of Specialty product sales. These channels allow customers to easily search for inventory, check product information including pictures and specifications, and ensure the ordered part matches the make and model of the vehicle. In addition, the platforms provide sales opportunities by suggesting complementary parts, which can increase cross-selling and overall transaction value.\n\n2. Enhancing Customer Experience: The digital channels support rapid delivery, offer marketing and technical assistance, and enable customer engagement through an easy-to-use interface, especially for small, independent businesses and large parts/accessory online retailers.\n\n3. Performance Tracking: Although the excerpt does not list specific performance metrics, it is reasonable to infer that LKQ Corporation tracks these channels over time through website and mobile app analytics. Likely measures include traffic volume, conversion rates (the percentage of visitors who make a purchase), average order value, and perhaps repeat customer behavior. These metrics let management assess the effectiveness of digital marketing initiatives, inventory availability, and the overall impact of e-commerce on revenue growth and profitability.\n\nIn summary, the digital channels are not only vital for driving a substantial share of sales but are also regularly monitored through standard online performance indicators to ensure continuous improvement in customer engagement and sales generation."

A review of the instruments that remain outstanding (i.e. those with final maturity dates beyond 2023) shows that almost all of the debt has fixed rates. For example, when summing the carrying values by type from the instruments maturing in 2024 and later, we find that fixed‐rate debt totals roughly US$12,950 million compared to about US$1,200 million in floating‑rate debt. In percentage terms, roughly 90% (or more) of the outstanding debt is fixed rate while only about 10% is floating rate. \n\nThis structure has important implications for interest rate risk management. With the majority of debt locked in at fixed rates, the company secures predictability in its debt service costs – an advantage if interest rates were to rise. The relatively small portion of floating‑rate debt means that only a limited share of total interest expense is subject to market rate fluctuations. However, it also means that if interest rates fall, the company might miss the opportunity to benefit from lower rates on its overall debt portfolio. In summary, the mix indicates a conservative approach: a heavy reliance on fixed‑rate borrowing reduces exposure to rising rates, while the modest floating‑rate component allows some flexibility in a falling rate environment."

      "ground_truth": "Calculation of operating margins (Operating income / Net sales) reveals the following:\n\n• 2021: Operating income was $1,189 million and net sales were $15,618 million, so the margin was approximately 7.6% (1,189/15,618 ≈ 0.0761).\n• 2022: Operating income was $1,263 million and net sales were $17,489 million, resulting in a margin of about 7.2% (1,263/17,489 ≈ 0.0722).\n• 2023: Operating income was $1,559 million with net sales of $20,051 million, giving an operating margin of roughly 7.8% (1,559/20,051 ≈ 0.0778).\n\nThese calculations indicate that while the operating margin declined slightly from 2021 to 2022, it rebounded in 2023 despite higher expenses.\n\nRegarding the impact of increased expenses:\n• Restructuring expenses increased significantly in 2023 ($211 million) compared to $85 million in 2022 and $24 million in 2021.\n• Amortization expenses also rose to $233 million in 2023, up from $149 million in 2022 (and $148 million in 2021).\n\nIf we remove the additional expenses in 2023 relative to 2022, there is an extra combined cost of approximately $210 million (i.e. $211 - $85 for restructuring plus $233 - $149 for amortization). Without these additional expenses, the 2023 operating income would have been roughly $1,769 million. This would have resulted in a higher operating margin of about 8.8% (1,769/20,051 ≈ 0.088), demonstrating that the increased restructuring and amortization expenses partially offset the benefits of higher net sales.\n\nIn summary, while Aptiv’s operating margin improved in 2023 relative to 2022 (rising to 7.8%), the increase in restructuring and amortization expenses dampened even greater improvements in margin, as evidenced by an estimated potential margin of nearly 8.8% in their absence."

        "The Company recognizes revenue at the amount to which it expects to be entitled when control of the products or services is transferred to its customers. Control is generally transferred when the Company has a present right to payment and title and the significant risks and rewards of ownership of products or services are transferred to its customers. For most of the Company’s Products net sales, control transfers when products are shipped. For the Company’s Services net sales, control transfers over time as services are delivered. Payment for Products and Services net sales is collected within a short period following transfer of control or commencement of delivery of services, as applicable.\nThe Company records reductions to Products net sales related to future product returns, price protection and other customer incentive programs based on the Company’s expectations and historical experience.\nFor arrangements with multiple performance obligations, which represent promises within an arrangement that are distinct, the Company allocates revenue to all distinct performance obligations based on their relative stand-alone selling prices (“SSPs”). When available, the Company uses observable prices to determine SSPs. When observable prices are not available, SSPs are established that reflect the Company’s best estimates of what the selling prices of the performance obligations would be if they were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis. The Company’s process for estimating SSPs without observable prices considers multiple factors that may vary depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each performance obligation including, where applicable, prices charged by the Company for similar offerings, market trends in the pricing for similar offerings, product-specific business objectives and the estimated cost to provide the performance obligation.\nThe Company has identified the performance obligations regularly included in arrangements involving the sale of iPhone, Mac and iPad. The first material performance obligation, which represents the substantial portion of the allocated sales price, is the hardware and bundled software delivered at the time of sale. The second material performance obligation is the right to receive certain product-related bundled services, which include iCloud®, Siri® and Maps. The Company allocates revenue and any related discounts to all of its performance obligations based on their relative SSPs. Because the Company lacks observable prices for product-related bundled services, the allocation of revenue is based on the Company’s estimated SSPs. Revenue allocated to the delivered hardware and bundled software is recognized when control has transferred to the customer, which generally occurs when the product is shipped. Revenue allocated to product-related bundled services is deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated period they are expected to be provided.\nFor certain long-term service arrangements, the Company has performance obligations for services it has not yet delivered. For these arrangements, the Company does not have a right to bill for the undelivered services. The Company has determined that any unbilled consideration relates entirely to the value of the undelivered services. Accordingly, the Company has not recognized revenue, and does not disclose amounts, related to these undelivered services.\nFor the sale of third-party products where the Company obtains control of the product before transferring it to the customer, the Company recognizes revenue based on the gross amount billed to customers. The Company considers multiple factors when determining whether it obtains control of third-party products, including evaluating if it can establish the price of the product, retains inventory risk for tangible products or has the responsibility for ensuring acceptability of the product. For third-party applications sold through the App Store, the Company does not obtain control of the product before transferring it to the customer. Therefore, the Company accounts for all third-party application–related sales on a net basis by recognizing in Services net sales only the commission it retains.\nNet sales disaggregated by significant products and services for 2024, 2023 and 2022 were as follows (in millions):\n2024\t\t2023\t\t2022\niPhone\n$\t201,183 \t\t\t$\t200,583 \t\t\t$\t205,489 \t\nMac\n29,984 \t\t\t29,357 \t\t\t40,177 \t\niPad\n26,694 \t\t\t28,300 \t\t\t29,292 \t\nWearables, Home and Accessories\n37,005 \t\t\t39,845 \t\t\t41,241 \t\nServices (1)\n96,169 \t\t\t85,200 \t\t\t78,129 \t\nTotal net sales\t$\t391,035 \t\t\t$\t383,285 \t\t\t$\t394,328 \t\n \n(1)Services net sales include amortization of the deferred value of services bundled in the sales price of certain products.\nTotal net sales include $7.7 billion of revenue recognized in 2024 that was included in deferred revenue as of September 30, 2023, $8.2 billion of revenue recognized in 2023 that was included in deferred revenue as of September 24, 2022, and $7.5 billion of revenue recognized in 2022 that was included in deferred revenue as of September 25, 2021.\nThe Company’s proportion of net sales by disaggregated revenue source was generally consistent for each reportable segment in Note 13, “Segment Information and Geographic Data” for 2024, 2023 and 2022, except in Greater China, where iPhone revenue represented a moderately higher proportion of net sales.\nAs of September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, the Company had total deferred revenue of $12.8 billion and $12.1 billion, respectively. As of September 28, 2024, the Company expects 64% of total deferred revenue to be realized in less than a year, 25% within one-to-two years, 9% within two-to-three years and 2% in greater than three years."

      "ground_truth": "Apple’s revenue recognition policy for long-term service arrangements ensures that revenue is recognized only when the related services are delivered. For arrangements where performance obligations are undelivered and unbilled, Apple does not recognize any revenue—meaning that these potential revenues remain in deferred revenue and are not reflected in current period earnings. This conservative approach has two major implications:\n\n1. Revenue Quality: By recognizing revenue only when control of the service has been transferred, Apple maintains high revenue quality. The recognized revenue is backed by delivered performance obligations, reducing the risk of revenue reversals or adjustments in subsequent periods. This conservatism increases the reliability of reported earnings for investors.\n\n2. Future Earnings Growth: While the current period revenue is not inflated by unbilled amounts, the deferred revenue represents future earnings that will be recognized as the services are provided. Investors must be aware that some portion of Apple’s potential earnings is deferrable and will contribute to future periods’ growth. However, this also means that future revenue recognition is tied to the actual delivery of services, which might lead to a smoothing effect on reported growth. Ultimately, while the policy may delay the impact of long-term service arrangements on current earnings, it also provides a clearer forecast for future earnings when these obligations are fulfilled.\n\nIn summary, Apple’s policy enhances the reliability and quality of its current revenue while signalling that deferred revenue is likely to contribute to future earnings growth as services are delivered."

        "PSE&G’s regulated electric and gas revenues are recorded primarily based on services rendered to customers. PSE&G records unbilled revenues for the estimated amount customers will be billed for services rendered from the time meters were last read to the end of the respective accounting period. The unbilled revenue is estimated each month based on usage per day, the number of unbilled days in the period, estimated seasonal loads based upon the time of year and the variance of actual degree-days and temperature-humidity-index hours of the unbilled period from expected norms.\nRegulated revenues from the transmission of electricity are recognized as services are provided based on a FERC-approved annual formula rate mechanism. This mechanism provides for an annual filing of estimated revenue requirement with rates effective January 1 of each year. After completion of the annual period ending December 31, PSE&G files a true-up whereby it compares its actual revenue requirement to the original estimate to determine any over or under collection of revenue. PSE&G records the estimated financial statement impact of the difference between the actual and the filed revenue requirement as a refund or deferral for future recovery when such amounts are probable and can be reasonably estimated in accordance with accounting guidance for rate-regulated entities.\nPSEG Power currently owns generation within PJM Interconnection, L.L.C.

PSEG generally reports electricity sales and purchases conducted with the PJM Independent System Operator (ISO) at PSEG Power on a net hourly basis in either Revenues or Energy Costs in its Consolidated Statement of Operations, the classification of which depends on the net hourly activity. Capacity revenue and expense are also reported net based on PSEG Power’s monthly net sale or purchase position in PJM. PSEG Power also has revenues that relate to bilateral contracts, which are accounted for on the accrual basis as the energy is delivered. PSEG Power’s revenue also includes changes in the value of energy derivative contracts. See Note 16.

        "The Company recognizes revenue from contracts with customers using the five step model prescribed in ASC 606. A substantial portion of the Company's revenue is recorded at a point in time. Revenue is recognized from the sale of products or services when obligations under the terms of the contract are satisfied and control of promised goods or services have transferred to the customer. Control is transferred when the customer has the ability to direct the use of and obtain benefits from the goods or services. Revenue is measured at the amount of consideration the Company expects to be paid in exchange for goods or services. In a limited number of contracts, control transfers to the customer over time, primarily in contracts where the customer is required to pay for the cost of both the finished and unfinished goods at the time of cancellation plus a reasonable profit relative to the work performed for products that were customized for the customer. Therefore, we recognize revenue over time for those agreements that have a right to margin and where the products being produced have no alternative use. For agreements with multiple performance obligations, judgment is required to determine whether performance obligations specified in these agreements are distinct and should be accounted for as separate revenue transactions for recognition purposes based on the standalone selling price of each performance obligation. The primary method used to estimate a standalone selling price is the price observed in standalone sales to customers for the same product or service. We consider the contractual consideration payable by the customer and assesses variable consideration that may affect the total transaction price. Variable consideration is included in the estimated transaction price when there is a basis to reasonably estimate the amount, including whether the estimate should be constrained in order to avoid a significant reversal of revenue in a future period. These estimates are based on historical experience, anticipated performance under the terms of the contract and our best judgment at the time."

      "ground_truth": "TransDigm’s dual approach to revenue recognition—using point-in-time recognition for many transactions and over time for others—has distinct implications on reported short-term revenue volatility and profitability metrics. For products or services whose control transfers at one point in time, revenue is recorded as a lump sum when the obligation is satisfied. This can result in larger revenue spikes when sizable transactions are completed, potentially contributing to heightened quarter-over-quarter volatility and variability in reported profit margins. In contrast, contracts where revenue is recognized over time spread the accounting entries across multiple reporting periods. This smooths out the revenue profile over the duration of the contract, thereby dampening short-term volatility and providing investors with more stable figures in terms of revenue and associated profitability metrics.\n\nFurthermore, the judgment required to separate performance obligations and estimate the standalone selling price for each can introduce estimation uncertainties. Although this impacts both the over time and point-in-time methods, the over time method may generally offer a smoother trend by averaging the revenue recognition across the contract’s time span. Consequently, investors might observe that while point-in-time recognized revenues can lead to occasional significant jumps (or drops) in short-term revenue numbers, over time recognized revenues contribute to more consistent reporting of profitability and margins over consecutive periods.\n\nIn summary, TransDigm’s mixed revenue recognition policy can lead to timing differences that affect short-term revenue and profitability volatility. Regular, recurring revenues from long-term contracts can improve trend stability, whereas point-in-time transactions may drive unexpected changes in reported figures from quarter to quarter, influencing investor perception of the company’s financial performance."

These reductions might lead investors to anticipate several potential risks and strategic shifts:\n\n1. Operational Efficiency Risks: Reduced investment in package handling and ground support equipment could constrain FedEx Ground’s capacity, potentially leading to delays in processing and handling. This may adversely impact service quality and on-time delivery performance, making it more challenging to cope with peak demand periods.\n\n2. Technology and Innovation Concerns: Lower spending on IT could slow the adoption of new technologies and digital upgrades that are critical to optimizing routing, tracking systems, and customer service. This may expose FedEx to risks related to cybersecurity, integration challenges, or lagging behind competitors who invest robustly in technology.\n\n3. Strategic Reallocation of Capital: The cuts may indicate a deliberate strategic decision to reallocate spend away from segments where returns might be lower or where costs have historically outweighed the benefits, possibly shifting focus towards more profitable or resilient segments (e.g., FedEx Express, which saw an 8% increase in capital spending). This could be part of a broader cost optimization or portfolio rebalancing effort.\n\n4. Competitive Positioning: If the reduction in capital expenditure negatively influences operational capabilities, FedEx could see a temporary decline in competitive positioning, especially as market dynamics evolve and competitors potentially capture market share by investing more aggressively in technological innovation and infrastructure enhancements.\n\nIn summary, while these spending cuts might be part of a strategic plan to streamline operations and focus on high-return investments, the potential risks include reduced operational efficiency, slower technological adaptation, and short-term competitive vulnerabilities. Investors should closely monitor how these cuts affect service performance and whether subsequent investments or adjustments are made to mitigate these risks."

        "Risk Management and Strategy\n\nOverview\n\nWe recognize that our clients entrust us with highly sensitive data. We also recognize our attendant responsibility to safeguard the accessibility, confidentiality, and integrity of this data. Our information security program consists of policies, procedures, systems, controls and technology designed to help us prevent, identify, detect and mitigate cybersecurity risks. Our processes are informed by cybersecurity events we have observed within the Company, across our industry, and across the cybersecurity landscape. We utilize the risk management framework for risk assessments as defined by the ISO 27001 Information Security Management Standard. We have integrated cybersecurity risk management into our overall risk management framework by conducting annual enterprise risk management assessments and IT risk management assessments, implementing periodic key risk indicator tracking, and holding periodic meetings among multiple department stakeholders to address cybersecurity risks. We review our information security policies at least annually and in connection with certain process changes to ensure that they meet the needs of the organization and the goals and objectives of the information security program.\n\nPrevention, Identification, Detection and Mitigation Activities\n\nWe routinely undertake activities to prevent, identify, detect and mitigate risks from cybersecurity threats, including but not limited to the following:\n\n•\nProcedures and guidelines designed to ensure that information security is a key consideration in the requirements for both new information systems and enhancements to existing systems and assets;\n•\nIT environment risk assessments conducted at regular intervals and in connection with certain events, such as implementation of a new system, service or vendor;\n•\nTabletop and simulation exercises to discuss roles and responsibilities of team members in the event of a cybersecurity incident and to test and modify the plan as needed;\n•\nOngoing security penetration testing and threat modeling of our network and web application;\n•\nAutomated tools and manual review processes to ensure ongoing compliance with technical standards and identify configuration issues and technical vulnerabilities;\n•\nEncryption of all communications with our servers, which are configured to utilize only high-grade encryption algorithms; and\n•\nOngoing employee training related to information security and data privacy policies and standards, including periodic phishing, vishing, and social engineering exercises.\nWe also have implemented and continue to maintain policies, procedures, systems, controls and technology to oversee and identify the cybersecurity risks associated with our use of third-party service providers. For example, we conduct thorough cybersecurity risk assessments of all third-party service providers prior to engagement and ongoing monitoring to ensure compliance with our robust cybersecurity requirements. The monitoring includes periodic audits of third-party systems and vendors. We engage third-party consultants and auditors in connection with assessing, identifying and managing material risks from cybersecurity threats. Our collaboration with these third parties includes independent audits, threat assessments, and consultation on security enhancements.\n\nInfrastructure; Network and Physical Security\n\nOur IT infrastructure is secured and monitored using a number of leading practices and tools across physical and logical security. This security is also continually monitored by our information security department. We strictly regulate and limit all access to servers and networks at each of our facilities. Local network access is restricted by domain authentication, using stringent access control lists. Remote network access is restricted by a defense-in-depth approach that includes redundant firewalls, preventing unauthorized access from external networks to systems within our local network. We also employ (i) network and endpoint intrusion detection, intrusion prevention, and data loss prevention sensors throughout our infrastructure, (ii) systems that monitor our infrastructure and alert our continuously staffed security operations center of potential cybersecurity issues, and (iii) a seasoned process for managing and installing patches for third-party applications.\n\nIncident Response\n\nWe maintain plans to address any cybersecurity incidents, including but not limited to Crisis Management Policies and Procedures, an Incident Response Plan, an Information Security Incident Management Policy and a Business Resiliency/Continuity Management Policy. Information security continuity is embedded in our business continuity management system to minimize the risk that continuity operations could result in a compromise to our security standards. We conduct business continuity, crisis communications and disaster recovery exercises at least annually to test and modify the plan, as needed. The activities related to the business continuity management system are routinely reported to executive management as part of our IT security team’s ongoing metrics reporting. In addition, reports related to activities and outcomes are provided to the audit committee on a quarterly basis.\nCertifications and Audits\n\nWe maintain the following ISO certifications related to our information systems:\n\n•\nISO 22301:2019 (standard for implementing and managing an effective business continuity management system);\n•\nISO/IEC 27001:2013 (security standard for information security management systems, covering our production, quality assurance and implementation environments);\n•\nISO 27701:2019 (standard for establishing, implementing, maintaining and continually improving a privacy information management system); and\n•\nISO 9001:2015 (standard for the implementation of quality management processes).\nWe voluntarily obtain third-party security examinations relating to our internal controls over financial reporting in accordance with SOC 1. Our SOC 1 examination is conducted every six months by one of the four largest independent international auditing firms, and addresses, among other areas, our physical and environmental safeguards for production data centers, data availability and integrity procedures, change management procedures and logical security procedures. We also obtain third-party examinations relating to our internal controls over security and privacy in accordance with SOC 2. Our SOC 2 examination is conducted every year and addresses, among other areas, internal controls around security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality and privacy. We publish SOC 1 reports semiannually and SOC 2 and SOC 3 reports annually.\n\nImpact of Risks from Cybersecurity Threats\n\nWe have experienced cybersecurity incidents in the ordinary course of business and will continue to experience risks from cybersecurity threats that could have a material adverse effect on our business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition. Although prior cybersecurity incidents have not had a material adverse effect on our business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition to date, any actual or perceived breach of our security could damage our reputation, cause existing clients to discontinue the use of our solution, prevent us from attracting new clients, or subject us to third-party lawsuits, regulatory investigations and fines or other actions or liabilities, any of which could materially adversely affect our business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition.\n\nGovernance\n\nBoth management and the Board of Directors are actively involved in the oversight of risks from cybersecurity threats. Our information security program is designed to ensure that management and the Board of Directors are adequately informed about, and provided with the tools necessary to monitor, (i) material risks from cybersecurity threats and (ii) our efforts related to the prevention, detection, mitigation, and remediation of cybersecurity incidents.\n\nRole of the Board of Directors\n\nThe Board of Directors has delegated to the audit committee primary responsibility for overseeing enterprise risk management, including oversight of risks from cybersecurity threats. The audit committee receives quarterly reports and updates from our Chief Information Officer and Executive Vice President of IT and Information Security with respect to cybersecurity risk management. Such reports cover the Company’s information security program, including its current status, capabilities, objectives and plans, as well as the evolving cybersecurity threat landscape.\n\nRole of Management\n\nThe Chief Information Officer oversees the activities of our IT and information security teams. Our Chief Information Officer has been with Paycom since 2005 and has more than 30 years of IT and software development experience. The Executive Vice President of IT and Information Security, who reports to our Chief Information Officer, is responsible for ensuring that both new implementations and ongoing operations comply with the policies, procedures, and guidelines of our information security program. Our Executive Vice President of IT and Information Security has been with Paycom for over a decade and has worked in technology development, improvement, infrastructure, and security for over 25 years. The Executive Vice President of IT and Information Security is supported by our Director of IT Security, who has worked in technology development, improvement, infrastructure, and security for over a decade. The Director of IT Security is responsible for the growth and implementation of the information security and data privacy programs and oversees the operations of the information security team. The Director of IT Security also provides oversight for information security and privacy policies and controls, oversees compliance activities, and provides metrics and guidance to executive management regarding the program. The aforementioned leaders and teams have a breadth of experience and manage programs related to governance, risk, and compliance; data privacy and security; vulnerability management; security operations; and application security.\n\nThe Chief Information Officer is regularly informed about the latest developments in cybersecurity, including potential threats and innovative risk management techniques. This ongoing knowledge acquisition is crucial for the effective prevention, detection, mitigation, and remediation of cybersecurity incidents. As discussed above, our information systems are routinely reviewed for compliance with information security policies and standards. Outcomes of reviews and audits are reported to the Director of IT  Security, Executive Vice President of IT and Information Security, and the Chief Information Officer. Relevant information about security nonconformities, incidents, and events are reported to the working group described below and to the Board of Directors. As discussed above, the Chief Information Officer and Executive Vice President of IT and Information Security report to the audit committee and the Board of Directors on cybersecurity matters at least quarterly.\n\nIn addition, we have established a working group composed of senior leaders from various departments, including operations, finance, IT, information security, audit, and legal. This working group’s responsibilities include (i) ensuring that information security goals and objectives are identified, meet organizational and business requirements, and are integrated into relevant processes, (ii) reviewing the effectiveness of the information security program, (iii) providing clear direction and highly visible management support for security initiatives, (iv) providing resources required for information security projects and initiatives, (v) overseeing programs to maintain information security awareness, including training and team-specific guidance, and (vi) coordinating the information security aspects of supplier relationships."

      "ground_truth": "Paycom’s comprehensive integration of cybersecurity risk management into its broader enterprise risk framework is a key factor that can bolster investors’ confidence in the company, particularly in terms of its ability to maintain business continuity during disruptive events. First, by embedding cybersecurity risk management within its overall risk management processes, Paycom ensures that potential cyber threats are not viewed in isolation but are considered alongside other business risks. This integrated approach means that strategic and operational decisions benefit from a holistic view of potential disruptions and threats, thus supporting proactive risk identification and mitigation.\n\nSpecific measures that enhance investor confidence include:\n\n1. Governance and Oversight: With active engagement from both management and the Board of Directors, including dedicated committees (such as the audit committee), investors can be reassured that cybersecurity risks are continuously monitored, assessed, and addressed. The fact that key executives with extensive experience are involved in overseeing information security further underscores a strong commitment to risk management.\n\n2. Rigorous Processes and Best Practices: The implementation of regular risk assessments, penetration testing, employee training (including simulated exercises), and incident response planning demonstrates that Paycom is well-prepared to handle potential cybersecurity incidents. Utilizing industry standards like ISO 27001 enhances the credibility of their security protocols.\n\n3. Third-Party Audits and Certifications: Routine audits (SOC 1 and SOC 2 examinations) and maintenance of international certifications (including ISO/IEC 27001, ISO 22301, ISO 27701, and ISO 9001) signal a rigorous commitment to maintaining high standards of both security and business continuity. These independent validations help to reduce uncertainty and reassure investors about the robustness of the company’s infrastructure.\n\nImplications for Future Growth Potential:\n\n• Business Continuity: A well-integrated cybersecurity framework minimizes the potential for service disruptions due to cyber incidents. Business continuity is critical not only for current operations but also for future growth, as it reflects the company’s ability to scale operations without being hampered by vulnerabilities.\n• Competitive Positioning: In an era where cybersecurity risks are a major concern for clients, demonstrating a strong risk management posture can be a market differentiator. It offers a competitive edge by attracting and retaining clients who demand high levels of operational integrity and data protection.\n• Investor Assurance: Financial markets value companies that can manage risks effectively. The fact that Paycom takes a proactive and integrated approach to cybersecurity suggests that the company is less likely to face disruptive, costly incidents that could impair its financial performance. This stability is an attractive quality for investors, making Paycom a potentially lower-risk investment.\n\nIn summary, the integration of robust cybersecurity risk management within Paycom’s overall enterprise risk framework not only fortifies its defenses against cyber threats but also conveys a proactive, forward-thinking approach to managing risks. This strategic initiative reassures investors about business continuity during disruptive events and supports the company’s future growth potential by underpinning operational resilience and competitive advantage."

The mix of younger executives (in their mid-40s) and senior leaders (with ages in the 60s and 70s) provides a blend of fresh perspectives and seasoned expertise.\n• However, the inclusion of individuals at the higher end of the age spectrum (such as the 71-year-old Executive Vice President) may indicate potential succession risks. As senior executives approach retirement, there’s a need to ensure that solid succession plans are in place and that emerging talent is groomed to fill critical roles.\n• This age distribution can impact strategic planning by necessitating a forward-looking approach to leadership continuity, as well as balancing innovation with experience. The relatively moderate average age overall supports investing in long-term leadership development while preparing for eventual transitions.\n\nIn summary, with an average age of 55, Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. benefits from a mix of experience and new ideas, but should carefully manage succession planning to mitigate risks stemming from an aging segment of its leadership."

For investors monitoring insider ownership trends, this stability can have several implications for the company’s risk profile:\n\n1. Consistent Insider Confidence: The absence of changes in trading arrangements suggests that insiders did not feel the need to preemptively manage their holdings in response to anticipated market or company-specific events. This consistency is often interpreted as a sign that insiders remain confident in the ongoing performance and prospects of the company, thereby reducing perceived behavioral risk.\n\n2. Reduced Signaling of Uncertainty: Sudden or significant changes in insider trading plans (such as initiating or terminating prearranged trading arrangements) can sometimes be interpreted as signals of impending uncertainty or volatility. The lack of such changes can be reassuring for investors, as it implies that there are no immediate red flags regarding internal information or strategic shifts.\n\n3. Enhanced Transparency: Stability in these arrangements implies a continuity in the way insider transactions are handled, which can be seen as part of a stable corporate governance environment. Investors may thus view the company’s internal controls and oversight as robust, which contributes to a lower risk perception.\n\nThus, while this piece of data alone does not capture the complete risk profile of The Kroger Co., it does provide a reassuring signal regarding insider behavior. It suggests that, at least in terms of insider trading activities, the company exhibits a stable environment that likely contributes to a lower perceived risk from the standpoint of strategic trading signals."

        "Risk Management and Strategy\n\nMaterial risks from cybersecurity threats are managed across GM, GM Financial, Cruise and third-party suppliers and vendors, and monitoring such risks and threats is integrated into the Company’s overall risk management program.\n\nGM has a Cybersecurity Management Board that brings together representatives from senior management across the Company’s Software & Services, Product Development, Information Technology, Manufacturing, Finance, Communications, Human Resources, Legal and Public Policy organizations to provide guidance and monitor overall company cybersecurity risk. The Company’s cybersecurity maturity scorecard, cybersecurity threats and certain incident information are reviewed by the Company’s Chief Cybersecurity Officer (CCO), the Risk and Cybersecurity Committee of the Company’s Board of Directors and the Cybersecurity Management Board during standing meetings as well as in impromptu sessions, when appropriate. During the reviews, various topics are discussed, which may include:\n\n•implementation and maturity of the Company’s cybersecurity program, risk management framework, including cybersecurity risk policies, procedures and governance;\n•cybersecurity and privacy risk, including potential impact to the Company’s employees, customers, supply chain, joint ventures and other stakeholders;\n•intelligence briefings on notable cyber events impacting the industry; and •cybersecurity budget and resource allocation, including industry benchmarking and economic modeling of various potential cybersecurity events.\n\nThe Company maintains technical and organizational safeguards, including employee training, incident response capability reviews and exercises, cybersecurity insurance and business continuity mechanisms for the protection of the Company’s assets. From time to time, the Company’s processes are audited and validated by internal and external experts. The Company leverages a third-party cybersecurity program with the goal of minimizing disruption to the Company’s business and production operations, strengthening supply chain resilience in response to cyber-related events and supporting the integrity of components and systems used in its products and services.\n\nAs cybersecurity incidents occur, the GM Cybersecurity team focuses on responding to and containing the threat and minimizing any business impact, as appropriate. In the event of an incident, the Cybersecurity team assesses, among other factors, safety impact, supply chain and manufacturing disruption, data and personal information loss, business operations disruption, projected cost and potential for reputational harm, with support from external technical, legal and law enforcement support, as appropriate.\n\nIn the last three fiscal years, the Company has not experienced any material cybersecurity incidents and expenses incurred from cybersecurity incidents were immaterial (including penalties and settlements, of which there were none). For a discussion of whether and how any risks from cybersecurity threats, including as a result of any previous cybersecurity incidents, have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the Company, including its business strategy, results of operations or financial condition, see Item 1A. Risk Factors – \"Risks related to our intellectual property, cybersecurity, information technology and data management practices\", which are incorporated by reference into this Item 1C.\n\nGovernance\n\nThe GM Board of Directors is responsible for overseeing the Company’s enterprise risk, and has established its Risk and Cybersecurity Committee with specific responsibility for overseeing cybersecurity threats, among other things. The Company’s cybersecurity organization is led by the CCO, who is responsible for assessing and managing material risks from cybersecurity threats and reports to GM’s Executive Vice President, Legal, Policy, Cybersecurity, and Corporate Secretary as well as to the Risk and Cybersecurity Committee. The CCO has served in this role for four years, and has more than 11 years of experience in various roles involving managing cybersecurity functions, developing cybersecurity strategies to protect privacy, customer safety and intellectual property, and developing key capabilities such as product security engineering, risk management and cybersecurity governance. The CCO holds a bachelor’s degree in electrical engineering and a master’s degree in systems engineering, with over 10 years of previous software and hardware systems engineering experience. The CCO chairs the Automotive – Information Sharing and Analysis Center (ISAC) and serves on the Department of Homeland Security – Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (DHS-CISA) Advisory Committee.\n\nThe CCO and the Cybersecurity Management Board monitor the prevention, mitigation, detection and remediation of cybersecurity incidents through their management of, and participation in, the cybersecurity risk management and strategy processes described above, including through the operation of the Company’s incident response plans, which include escalation to the CCO and the Cybersecurity Management Board, as appropriate. As discussed above, the CCO reports out to the Risk and Cybersecurity Committee about cybersecurity threat risks, among other cybersecurity related matters, at least quarterly."

        "Our markets are highly competitive. Many of the markets in which we compete are fragmented both geographically and by application, particularly the industrial and food retailing markets. As a result, we face numerous regional or specialized competitors, many of which are well established in their markets. For example, some of our competitors are divisions of larger companies with potentially greater financial and other resources than our own. In addition, some of our competitors are domiciled in emerging markets and may have a lower cost structure than ours. We are confronted with new competitors in emerging markets which, although relatively small in size today, could become larger companies in their home markets. Given the sometimes significant growth rates of these emerging markets, and in light of their cost advantage over developed markets, emerging market competitors could become more significant global competitors. Taken together, the competitive forces present in our markets can impair our operating margins in certain product lines and geographic markets.\nWe expect our competitors to continue to improve the design and performance of their products and to introduce new products with competitive prices. Although we believe that we have technological and other competitive advantages over many of our competitors, we may not be able to realize and maintain these advantages. These advantages include our worldwide market leadership positions; our global brand and reputation; our track record of technological innovation; our comprehensive, high-quality solution offering; our global sales and service offering; our large installed base of instruments; and the diversification of our revenue base by geographic region, product range, application, and customer. To remain competitive, we must continue to invest in research and development, sales and marketing, customer service and support, and operational excellence throughout our supply chain. We cannot be sure that we will have sufficient resources to continue to make these investments or that we will be successful in identifying, developing, and maintaining any competitive advantages.\nWe believe the principal competitive factors in developed markets for purchasing decisions are the product itself, application support, service support, and price. In emerging markets, where there is greater demand for less sophisticated products, price is a more important factor than in developed markets. Competition in the U.S. laboratory market is also influenced by the presence of large distributors that sell not only our products but those of our competitors as well."

First, its diversified revenue base—which spans multiple geographic regions, product ranges, and applications—ensures that the company does not rely on any single market segment. This diversification acts as a buffer since competitive pressure in one area may be offset by stronger performance in another. Secondly, the company emphasizes maintaining and enhancing its competitive advantages, including a strong global brand, a large installed base, and a track record of technological innovation. Investment in research and development (R&D), sales and marketing, and customer service and support allows the company to continuously improve product design and performance, and to introduce new, competitively positioned products. Additionally, operational excellence throughout its supply chain helps control costs and preserve operating margins in various regions. Collectively, these initiatives position the company to sustain healthy margins despite the presence of established competitors and emerging market entrants with potentially lower cost structures."

        "Litigation. From time to time, in the ordinary course of business, we and our subsidiaries are subject to various litigation, investigations, and administrative proceedings. Private, civil litigation may range from individual actions involving a single plaintiff to putative class action lawsuits with potentially thousands of class members. Investigations may involve both formal and informal proceedings, by both government agencies and self-regulatory bodies. These matters may involve claims for substantial monetary relief. At times, these matters may present novel claims or legal theories. Due to the complex nature of these various other matters, it may be years before some matters are resolved. While it is impossible to ascertain the ultimate resolution or range of financial liability, based on information presently known to us, we do not believe there is any matter to which we are a party, or involving any of our properties that, individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. We continually monitor and reassess the potential materiality of these litigation matters. We note, however, that in light of the inherent uncertainty in legal proceedings there can be no assurance that the ultimate resolution will not exceed established reserves. As a result, the outcome of a particular matter, or a combination of matters, may be material to our results of operations for a particular period, depending upon the size of the loss or our income for that particular period.\n\nRecord-Keeping Investigation. On February 9, 2024, the Company’s broker-dealer subsidiary, KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc. (KBCM), and investment advisory subsidiary, Key Investment Services (KIS), entered into a resolution with the SEC to resolve the SEC’s investigation concerning compliance with certain record-keeping requirements relating to business communications transmitted on unapproved electronic communications platforms. Under this resolution, KBCM and KIS agreed to pay a penalty of $10 million to the SEC along with other prospective relief.\n\nGurevitch Litigation. On August 4, 2023, a putative class action, Gurevitch v. KeyCorp et al., was filed against KeyCorp and certain of its current and former executives in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio. The named plaintiff seeks to represent a national class of individuals who purchased or acquired KeyCorp securities from February 2020 to June 2023 and who were allegedly harmed by certain disclosures relating to KeyCorp’s liquidity, operations, and prospects. The lead plaintiff is scheduled to file an amended complaint in March 2024. At this stage of the proceedings, it is too early to determine if the matter would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\n\nDerivative Litigation. In November and December 2023, purported shareholders of KeyCorp filed two shareholder\nderivative lawsuits in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio. The lawsuits assert that\nvarious officers and directors violated their duties to KeyCorp by virtue of the matters alleged in the Gurevitch\nlitigation described above. The lawsuits are purportedly brought on behalf of KeyCorp and seek relief on KeyCorp’s\nbehalf and for its benefit."

For example, apart from the record-keeping investigation – where the broker-dealer and investment advisory subsidiaries agreed to pay a specific penalty of $10 million – the company describes the other litigation (such as the Gurevitch and derivative cases) in largely qualitative terms. KeyCorp notes that, based on current information, none of these matters, individually or in the aggregate, is expected to have a material adverse impact on its overall financial condition. In practice, this means that while the Company monitors and reassesses the potential liability from litigation continuously, it does not quantify these risks with precise numbers beyond what has been settled or disclosed (like the record-keeping penalty). Instead, the firm’s management relies on a qualitative risk assessment process integrated into its broader framework for evaluating liquidity, capital reserves, and overall risk exposure. This approach reflects the inherent uncertainty in legal proceedings, where the ultimate resolutions may not be determinable until later, and financial impacts can be affected by factors such as reserve adjustments and timing relative to the Company’s income."

      "ground_truth": "The significant drop in net income—with 2022 reporting approximately $940.5 million and 2023 only about $325.1 million—is largely mirrored by a steep decline in total revenues, which fell from about $24.70 billion in 2022 to roughly $17.60 billion in 2023. Looking at the components, the Transportation segment experienced a major revenue decrease (from approximately $23.52 billion down to $16.37 billion), whereas the Sourcing segment remained relatively stable. This revenue contraction suggests that operational challenges such as lower shipment volumes, less favorable freight rate environments, or reduced demand in the transportation market may have been key factors.\n\nFrom a cost management perspective, although costs and expenses declined in absolute terms (for instance, purchased transportation and related services fell from about $20.04 billion to $13.89 billion), the proportional drop in revenue was more severe. This contributed to thinner operating margins as the company might not have been able to sufficiently adjust its cost structure or improve pricing in response to a downturn in volumes. In other words, the firm’s cost management measures and pricing strategies may not have been aggressive or flexible enough to protect profitability during a period of market pressure. In a competitive environment, if price negotiations become tougher or if clients shift to lower-cost alternatives, a company like C.H. Robinson might see its ability to pass along costs weaken, which could explain the eroding net income.\n\nIn summary, the data indicates that the decline in net income is primarily due to operational factors—especially a significant drop in transportation revenue likely driven by market conditions—and that the firm’s cost management and pricing strategies may not have fully mitigated the impact of these adverse market trends."

      "ground_truth": "The question is answerable, but answering it requires drawing on specific financial metrics from Paramount Global’s own statements as well as comparable figures from its major competitors. Key metrics that analysts typically use to assess the impact of competitive pressures on operating margins include:\n\n1. Operating Margin (Operating Income/Revenue): This shows how efficiently the company is controlling its operating costs relative to its revenues. It directly indicates how competitive pressures (like pricing and cost increases) are affecting profitability.\n\n2. EBITDA Margin (EBITDA/Revenue): EBITDA provides insight into core profitability before noncash charges such as depreciation and amortization. It’s useful for comparisons across companies that may have different capital structures or depreciation policies.\n\n3. Cost-to-Revenue Ratios (e.g., Content Costs as a % of Revenue): Since competitive pressures often influence spending on content acquisition and production, tracking this ratio helps assess how much is being spent to gain or maintain market share in competitive environments.\n\n4. Revenue Growth and Compression of Operating Expenses: An analysis of revenue growth trends alongside changes in operating expenses (including SG&A, marketing, and content acquisition costs) reveals if the company is succeeding in managing cost pressures while growing revenue.\n\n5. Comparisons with Leading Competitors: To evaluate competitive positioning, you would compare these ratios with those of industry leaders such as other large media conglomerates. For example, if leading competitors consistently report higher operating margins, this may indicate that Paramount Global needs to reassess its cost structure or strategy relative to the competitive mix.\n\nA practical approach would be to calculate the operating margins and EBITDA margins over time from Paramount Global’s financial statements, and then compare these figures with publicly available metrics from competitors (for instance, from their annual reports or industry analysis). If, say, Paramount’s operating margin is 15% while the industry leader’s is 20%, it can suggest that competitive forces such as increased content spending or lower scale efficiency might be eroding margins.\n\nOverall, by analyzing these financial ratios and trend data alongside industry benchmarks, one can assess both current competitive pressures and the company’s potential to improve its operating efficiency relative to its peers."

      "reference": [
        "Cybersecurity Risk Management and Strategy\n\nRisk Assessment and Management\n\nThe Company is increasingly dependent on the use of complex technology and systems to run its operations and support its strategic objectives. These technologies and systems include, among others, the Company's website and reservation system; flight dispatch and tracking systems; flight simulators; check-in kiosks; aircraft maintenance, planning, and record keeping systems; telecommunications systems; flight planning and scheduling systems; crew scheduling systems; human resources systems; and financial planning, management, and accounting systems. Additionally, the Company must receive certain confidential or personal information related to its Customers and\nEmployees to run its business, and the Company's operations depend upon secure collection, processing, retention, and transmission of such information. Therefore, the performance, reliability, and security of the Company's technology infrastructure and information systems are critical to the Company's operations and initiatives.\n\nThe Company has an enterprise risk management (“ERM”) program to identify, evaluate, and manage risks. Cybersecurity risks are evaluated alongside other critical business risks under the ERM program to align cybersecurity efforts with the Company's broader business goals and objectives. The Company believes that integrating cybersecurity risks into its ERM program fosters a proactive and holistic approach to cybersecurity, which helps safeguard the Company’s operations, financial condition, and reputation in an ever-evolving threat landscape.\n\nThe Company maintains a cybersecurity program that is designed to identify, protect from, detect, respond to, and recover from cybersecurity threats and risks, and protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of its information systems, including the information residing on such systems. The National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework helps the Company inform its cybersecurity agenda and prioritize its cybersecurity activities. The Company takes a risk-based approach to cybersecurity, which begins with the identification and evaluation of cybersecurity risks or threats that could affect the Company’s operations, finances, legal or regulatory compliance, or reputation. Once identified, cybersecurity risks and related mitigation efforts are prioritized based on their potential impact, likelihood, velocity, and vulnerability, considering both quantitative and qualitative factors. Risk mitigation strategies are developed and implemented based on the specific nature of each cybersecurity risk. These strategies include, among others, the application of cybersecurity policies and procedures, implementation of administrative, technical, and physical controls, and Employee training, education, and awareness initiatives. The Company’s cybersecurity risk management also includes a Security Operations Center (“SOC”) that conducts ongoing monitoring of networks and systems for potential signs of suspicious activity. The SOC is a centralized function that monitors security alerts to initiate triage, verification, and remediation activities. Additionally, the Company’s cybersecurity program provides mechanisms for Employees to report any unusual or potentially malicious activity they observe. The Company tracks key performance indicators and cybersecurity metrics to evaluate the efficacy of its cybersecurity controls and practices. Further, the Company’s cybersecurity program is periodically reviewed by its Cybersecurity Leaders (as defined below) and adjusted in an effort to maintain the program’s agility and responsiveness as circumstances evolve, new cybersecurity threats emerge, and regulations change.\n\nIncident Response\n\nThe Company has a dedicated cybersecurity incident response team responsible for managing and coordinating the Company’s cybersecurity incident response efforts. This team also collaborates closely with other teams in identifying, protecting from, detecting, responding to, and recovering from cybersecurity incidents. Cybersecurity incidents that meet certain thresholds are escalated to the Cybersecurity Leaders and cross-functional teams on an as-needed basis for support and guidance. Additionally, this team tracks cybersecurity incidents to help identify and analyze them. The Company’s cybersecurity incident response team partners with the Company’s internal cybersecurity teams as well as with external legal advisors, communication specialists, and other key stakeholders as appropriate to respond to cybersecurity incidents. The Company maintains a cybersecurity incident response plan to prepare for and respond to cybersecurity incidents. The incident response plan includes standard processes for reporting and escalating cybersecurity incidents to senior management. Additionally, the Company conducts at least one cybersecurity tabletop exercise on an annual basis, where members of a cross-functional team engage in a simulated cybersecurity incident scenario. This preparedness exercise is intended to provide hands-on training for the participants and helps the Company assess its processes and capabilities in addressing cybersecurity threats.\n\nUse of Third Parties\n\nCybersecurity Service Providers and Third-Party Consultants. The Company engages cybersecurity consultants, auditors, and other third parties to assess and enhance its cybersecurity practices. These third parties conduct assessments, penetration testing, and vulnerability assessments to identify weaknesses and recommend improvements. Additionally, the Company leverages a number of third-party tools and technologies as part of its efforts to enhance cybersecurity functions. This includes a managed security service provider to augment the Company’s dedicated SOC team, an endpoint detection and response system for continuous monitoring, detection, and response capabilities, and a security information and event management solution to automate real-time threat detection, investigation, and prioritization of high-fidelity alerts.\n\nOversight of Third-Party Service Providers. The Company also uses third-party service providers to support its operations and many of its technology initiatives. The Company evaluates third-party service providers from a cybersecurity risk perspective, which may include an assessment of that service provider’s cybersecurity posture or a recommendation of specific mitigation controls. Following an evaluation, the Company determines and prioritizes service provider risk based on potential threat impact and likelihood, and such risk determinations drive the level of due diligence and ongoing compliance monitoring required for each service provider.\n\nRisks from Material Cybersecurity Threats\n\nAs of the date of this report, the Company has not identified any cybersecurity threats that have materially affected or are reasonably anticipated to have a material effect on the organization. Although the Company has not experienced cybersecurity incidents that are individually, or in the aggregate, material, the Company has experienced cyberattacks in the past, which the Company believes have thus far been mitigated by preventative, detective, and responsive measures put in place by the Company. For a detailed discussion of the Company’s cybersecurity related risks, see “Item 1.A Risk Factors—Information Technology Risks.”\n\nCybersecurity Governance\n\nBoard Oversight\n\nThe Board is responsible for overseeing management’s assessments of major risks facing the Company and for reviewing options to mitigate such risks. The Board’s oversight of major risks, including cybersecurity risks, occurs at both the full Board level and at the Board committee level through the Audit Committee.\n\nThe Board. The Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Operating Officer, the Chief Financial Officer, members of senior management, and other personnel and advisors, as requested by the Board, report on the Company’s financial, operating, and commercial strategies, as well as major related risks, which may include cybersecurity risks, at regularly scheduled meetings of the Board. Based on these reports, the Board requests follow-up data and presentations to address any specific concerns and recommendations. Additionally, the Audit Committee has opportunities to report regularly to the entire Board and review with the Board any major issues that arise at the committee level, which may include cybersecurity risks.\n\nThe Audit Committee. The Audit Committee reviews with management the Company’s technology and cybersecurity frameworks, policies, programs, opportunities, and risk profile at its regularly scheduled meetings. The Company’s Chief Information Officer (“CIO”), Chief Information Security Officer (“CISO”), members of the cybersecurity team, or other advisors, as requested by the Audit Committee, report quarterly on the Company’s technology, data privacy, and cybersecurity strategies and risks. Cybersecurity topics are presented to the Audit Committee on a quarterly basis and generally highlight any significant cybersecurity incidents, the cyber threat landscape, cybersecurity program enhancements, cybersecurity risks and related mitigation activities, and any other relevant cybersecurity topics. Management believes that this regular cadence of reporting helps to provide the Audit Committee with an informed understanding of the Company’s dynamic cybersecurity program and threat landscape. The Audit Committee further reviews with management the Company’s business continuity and disaster recovery plans and capabilities and the effectiveness of the Company’s escalation procedures. Based on these management reports, the Audit Committee may request follow-up data and presentations to address any specific concerns and recommendations. In addition to this regular reporting, significant cybersecurity risks or threats may also be escalated on as needed basis to the Audit Committee. Management’s Role\n\nThe Company has a dedicated cybersecurity organization within its technology department that focuses on current and emerging cybersecurity matters. The Company’s cybersecurity function is led by the Company’s CISO, who reports to the Company’s CIO. The CISO and CIO (collectively, the Company’s “Cybersecurity Leaders”) are actively involved in assessing and managing cybersecurity risks. They are responsible for implementing cybersecurity policies, programs, procedures, and strategies. The responsibilities and relevant experience of each of the Cybersecurity Leaders are listed below:\n\n•The CIO provides leadership for the Company’s technology department. The CIO holds an undergraduate degree from Cornell and has served in various roles in information technology for over 20 years, including Vice President, Senior Director, Manager and Consultant.\n\n•The CISO is responsible for all aspects of cybersecurity across the Company’s facilities, airports, and aircraft fleet, which includes security engineering, security operations, incident response, threat intelligence, risk and compliance, and vulnerability management. The CISO has served in various roles in information technology for nearly 40 years at numerous technology companies and consulting firms. The CISO earned a Bachelor of Science in Industrial Engineering from Louisiana State University, a Master of Science in Management Information Systems from The University of Texas at Dallas, and a Master of Business Administration from Southern Methodist University.\n\nThe Company’s cybersecurity department is comprised of teams that engage in a range of cybersecurity activities such as threat intelligence, security architecture, and incident response. These teams conduct vulnerability management and penetration testing to identify, classify, prioritize, remediate, and mitigate vulnerabilities. Leaders from each team regularly meet with the Cybersecurity Leaders to provide visibility of major issues and seek alignment with strategy. As noted above under “Incident Response,” the Company’s cybersecurity incident response plan includes standard processes for reporting and escalating cybersecurity incidents to senior management. Cybersecurity incidents that meet certain thresholds are escalated to the Cybersecurity Leaders and cross-functional teams on an as-needed basis for support and guidance. The Company’s incident response team also coordinates with external legal advisors, communication specialists, and other key stakeholders."

      "ground_truth": "Between 2021 and 2023, United Airlines shifted from an operating loss of about $1.0 billion to an operating income of approximately $4.2 billion. This turnaround was driven by a robust recovery in revenues combined with more moderated expense growth. For example, total operating revenue more than doubled, rising from roughly $24.6 billion in 2021 to about $53.7 billion in 2023 – largely due to a strong rebound in passenger revenue (which more than doubled from approximately $20.2 billion to $49.0 billion). Although operating expenses also increased over the period, they did not rise in lockstep with revenue. Notably, many expense categories such as salaries and related costs increased, but the overall cost structure was better managed relative to the surge in revenue. One of the most influential factors was the change in the \"Special charges\" line item. In 2021, special charges provided a credit (recorded as −$3.37 billion), while by 2023, the expense was only about $0.95 billion. In addition, while fuel costs did increase from about $5.76 billion to $12.65 billion, their share of revenue remained controlled compared to the dramatic boost in operating income. In summary, it was the combination of sharply higher passenger revenues, controlled growth in operating costs, and changes in key expense items (especially the treatment of special charges) that resulted in the significant improvement in operating margins."

        "Product Litigation\n\nAs a manufacturer of weapons and other law enforcement tools used in high-risk field environments, we are often the subject of products liability litigation concerning the use of our products. We are currently named as a defendant in five lawsuits in which the plaintiffs allege either wrongful death or personal injury in situations in which a TASER CEDwas used by law enforcement officers in connection with arrests or training. While the facts vary from case to case, these product liability claims typically allege defective product design, manufacturing, and/or failure to warn. They seek compensatory and sometimes punitive damages, often in unspecified amounts.\n\n\nWe continue to aggressively defend all product litigation. As a general rule, it is our policy not to settle suspect injury or death cases. Exceptions are sometimes made where the settlement is strategically beneficial to us. Due to the confidential nature of our litigation strategy and the confidentiality agreements that are executed in the event of a settlement, we do not identify or comment on specific settlements by case or amount. Based on current information, we do not believe that the outcome of any such legal proceeding will have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. We are self-insured for the first $5.0 million of any product claim made after 2014. No judgment or settlement has ever exceeded this amount in any products case. We continue to maintain product liability insurance coverage, including an insurance policy fronting arrangement, above our self-insured retention with various limits depending on the policy period.\n\n\nAntitrust Litigation\n\nIn January 2020, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) filed an administrative enforcement action regarding our May 2018 acquisition of an insolvent body-worn camera competitor, Vievu LLC (“Vievu”). The FTC alleged the merger was anticompetitive and adversely affected the body-worn camera and digital evidence management market for “large metropolitan police departments,” which we deny and aggressively defended. On October 6, 2023, the FTC unilaterally dismissed its administrative complaint against Axon without consent decree or other condition.\n\n\nNow pending in the District of New Jersey (Case No. 3:23-cv-7182) is a purported class action based primarily on the same dismissed FTC allegations that the Vievu acquisition substantially lessened competition in the body-worn camera systems market for U.S. law enforcement agencies. The Township of Howell (NJ), the City of Augusta (ME) and the City of Baltimore (MD) filed their consolidated amended complaint on November 27, 2023, alleging Sherman and Clayton Act violations against both Axon and Safariland LLC, which sold Vievu to Axon. The complaint further alleges that an ancillary holster supply agreement between Axon and Safariland LLC constituted an illegal restraint of trade in the long-range conducted energy weapon market. Axon denies the allegations and will vigorously defend the case. The parties have agreed on a briefing schedule concerning anticipated motion practice through mid-May, with rulings unlikely in 2024."

The company’s policy of not settling “suspect injury or death cases” (with limited exceptions for strategic benefit) implies that management is confident in its legal position and anticipates that defense expenditures and potential liabilities will be less costly over time than the uncertainty and potential high payouts often associated with settlements. This approach is supported by the practice of self-insuring for the first $5 million of any claim and maintaining supplemental product liability insurance. Such measures help contain legal liabilities and preserve cash, which in turn allows Axon to allocate capital more efficiently towards its core operations and growth initiatives rather than devoting significant resources to settlement expenses. Overall, the strategy reflects a commitment to safeguarding financial health by managing litigation risks probabilistically, ensuring that adverse legal outcomes do not materially affect its financial position, results of operations, or cash flows."

      "ground_truth": "The data indicates that the $708 million increase in cash flow from operations in 2024 was driven primarily by two factors:\n\n1. Lower Cash Outflows on Inventory Purchases: In 2024, the company experienced reduced cash spending on inventory purchases compared to 2023. This improvement in working capital management helped retain more cash from core operations.\n\n2. Increase in Operating Profit: The company’s higher operating profit in 2024 positively impacted cash flow from operations. As profitability improved, less cash was required to fund day-to-day operations, thereby boosting available cash.\n\nRegarding the sustainability of these factors for future growth:\n\n• Lower inventory outflows can be sustainable if ResMed continues to optimize its inventory and supply chain management. However, this is subject to market demand fluctuations, supplier dynamics, and potential changes in the operating environment. Continuing improvements in inventory efficiency or adjustments in purchasing strategies could help maintain this benefit.\n\n• The increase in operating profit is likely tied to improved operational efficiency, pricing strategies, or increased market demand. If these improvements are driven by sustainable competitive advantages—such as stronger market positioning, innovation, or effective cost management—then the trend may continue. However, sustaining higher operating profits will also depend on the company’s ability to manage competitive pressures, market volatility, and potential regulatory changes.\n\nIn summary, while the improvements in cash flow from operations are clearly attributable to better working capital management (i.e., lower inventory outflows) and greater operating profitability in 2024, their future sustainability will depend on how consistently ResMed can maintain these operational efficiencies and profit-growth drivers in a dynamic market environment."

        "Risk Management and Strategy\nOur information security program includes administrative, technical and physical safeguards and is designed to provide an appropriate level of protection to maintain the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our Company’s, our client’s and our customers’ information. This includes protecting against known and evolving threats to the security of customer records and information, and against unauthorized access, compromise, or loss of customer records or information.\nOur information security program is designed to continuously adapt to an evolving landscape of emerging threats and available technology. Through data gathering and evaluation of emerging threats from internal and external incidents and technology investments, security controls are adjusted on an as needed basis. We have developed a security strategy and implemented layers of controls embedded throughout our technology environment that establish multiple control points between threats and our assets. We test the effectiveness of our controls and data protection processes through internal and independent external audits and assessments, including regular penetration tests, application code reviews, vulnerability scans, disaster recovery tests and cyber exercises to simulate hacker attacks. Our information security program is supported by regular training of information security employees and awareness training and activities for executives, directors, and employees companywide through which we communicate our information security policies, standards, processes and practices.\nFurther, our information security program is designed to provide oversight of third parties who store, process or have access to sensitive data, and we require similar levels of protection from third-party service providers as are required for the Company. We maintain supplier risk assessment processes to identify risks associated with third-party service providers and have implemented enhanced cybersecurity incident and data breach response requirements for critical supplier relationships.\nWe employ business continuity, backup and disaster recovery procedures for all the systems that are used for storing, processing and transferring customer information, and we periodically test and validate our disaster recovery plans to validate our resilience capabilities. Additionally, we maintain insurance coverage that, subject to applicable terms and conditions, may cover certain aspects of cybersecurity and information risks. However, there can be no assurance that liabilities or losses we may incur will be covered under such policies or that the amount of insurance will be adequate.\nOur information security program is designed and managed to be consistent with the Cyber Risk Institute (CRI) Profile, a cybersecurity assessment framework which is a financial services industry-specific extension of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework. We measure and monitor the maturity of the information security program against this framework, industry guidance, and a risk-driven metrics program aligned to our business requirements. Along with periodically being examined by our regulators, Synchrony regularly engages external experts to audit, evaluate and validate our controls against these standard frameworks, and we adjust our cybersecurity policies, standards, processes and practices as necessary based on the information provided by these examinations, audits and evaluations.\nCybersecurity threats, including as a result of any previous cybersecurity incidents, have not materially affected the Company during the past three fiscal years. While we are not currently aware of any cybersecurity threats that are reasonably likely to materially affect the Company there is no assurance that we will not be materially affected by such threats in the future. For additional information on our risks related to cybersecurity, see “Risk Factors Relating to Our Business—Cyber-attacks or other security breaches could have a material adverse effect on our business.”\nGovernance\nOur Board's fully independent Risk Committee oversees cybersecurity risk. Cybersecurity risk is a component of operational risk within our enterprise risk management framework. For a detailed description of our enterprise risk management framework, including its governance and processes, see “Risks—Risk Management.”\nOur information security team, led by our Chief Information Security Officer (\"CISO\"), in collaboration with our Risk Committee and our executive leadership team, closely monitors our information security program, including our\nstrategy, and information security policies and practices, against a rapidly evolving landscape of threats. The Risk Committee receives reports and briefings on our information security and enterprise risk management programs at least quarterly, including the results of any external audits, examinations and evaluations, as well as maturity assessments of our information security program.\nThe CISO team leading our information security program is responsible for identifying, assessing, managing and controlling cybersecurity risk, and for mitigating our cybersecurity risk exposure. Our information security program is monitored and challenged by our risk management team, led by our CRO.\nWe have developed an incident response governance framework to timely report cybersecurity incidents to our executive management team, appropriate management committees, including the enterprise risk management committee, the Risk Committee and Board, as necessary.

Synchrony Financial’s detailed description of its information security program reveals that it is designed to continuously adapt to an evolving threat landscape, while regulatory oversight and independent audits ensure adherence to industry standards. However, future regulatory changes or emerging cybersecurity threats could impact the effectiveness of these policies in several ways:\n\n1. Regulatory Changes:\n   - Stricter Compliance Requirements: New regulations may impose additional security standards, thereby increasing the costs of compliance and necessitating further investments in technology and personnel. This could affect operating expenses and, if not managed well, margins over the long term.\n   - Enhanced Reporting and Disclosure: Increased regulatory demands for transparency may require more rigorous, frequent reporting and could expose the company to more public scrutiny. If issues are detected, this could undermine investor confidence.\n   - Greater Penalties and Legal Risks: Should the company fail to meet new regulatory mandates, it might face heavier fines or sanctions. The financial impact of penalties and subsequent legal costs could affect overall profitability and the firm’s balance sheet.\n\n2. Emerging Cybersecurity Threats:\n   - Increased Risk of Data Breaches: As cyber threats evolve, even robust systems may become vulnerable. A significant breach could trigger reputational damage, customer attrition, costs related to incident response, litigation, and regulatory investigations.\n   - Escalating Investment in Security: To counter new risks, Synchrony may have to continuously upgrade its cybersecurity infrastructure, which can strain financial resources. The ongoing need for increased capital expenditure in areas such as advanced threat detection and employee training can impact free cash flow.\n   - Impact on Supply Chain and Third-Party Risk: As threats grow more sophisticated, vulnerabilities may also arise from the company’s third-party vendors. This may require more comprehensive third-party risk management and could expose the company to additional operational risks.\n\nPotential Implications for Long-term Financial Health and Investor Confidence:\n   - Balance Sheet and Earnings Impact: Increased regulatory cost and potential cybersecurity incidents can lead to higher operating expenses, fines, and legal liabilities—all of which may negatively impact earnings and free cash flow over time.\n   - Reputational and Market Confidence: Both regulatory breaches and a high-profile security incident can erode trust among investors and customers. Sustained damage to reputation can reduce market share and escalate the cost of capital if investors perceive higher risk.\n   - Strategic and Operational Adjustments: To maintain competitiveness, Synchrony must adapt its risk management framework and continuously update security technologies. While these investments can hedge long-term risks, they may also temporarily compress margins and ROI.\n\nIn summary, while Synchrony Financial has robust policies in place, the effectiveness of its information security program could be challenged by tighter regulatory scrutiny and new cybersecurity threats. These challenges may elevate costs, affect earnings, and potentially erode investor confidence, especially if the company is perceived as lagging behind in adapting to these evolving risks. Therefore, continuous adaptation and effective risk management will be critical for safeguarding long-term financial health and sustaining investor trust."

The markets for the services we provide are highly fragmented and competitive. Many of these providers compete with us across our segments, markets and geographies. Some of these competitors possess greater financial, sales and marketing resources than we do. We expect each of our segments to become more competitive over time, as advances in technology enable new entrants, barriers to entry fall and existing providers expand their services, both operationally and geographically.\n\nOur Merchant Solutions segment competes with financial institutions, merchant acquirers and other financial technology companies who provide businesses with merchant acquiring and related services. In the United States, we compete with a large number of providers, including but not limited to Fiserv, Inc. (\"Fiserv\"), Worldpay, LLC (\"Worldpay\"), Chase Paymentech Solutions, LLC, Elavon, Inc., a subsidiary of U.S. Bancorp, Bank of America Merchant Services, Wells Fargo Merchant Services, Toast, Inc., Stripe, Inc., Shopify Inc. and Block Inc. While these are our primary competitors in the merchant acquiring space, our vertically focused businesses in the United States compete with numerous other providers in their respective verticals.\n\nInternationally, financial institutions remain the primary providers of payment technology services to merchants, although the outsourcing of these services to third-party service providers is becoming more prevalent. We compete outside the U.S. with financial institutions in the markets in which we operate, as well as both large providers (such as Worldpay, Worldline, Nexi) and new entrants (such as Adyen, Block and Stripe). We have seen competition internationally increase and expect that trend to continue as new companies enter our markets and existing competitors expand or consolidate their product lines and services.\n\nOur Issuer Solutions segment encounters competition from other third-party payment card processors, the card brands, core banking platform providers, independent software vendors, B2B providers, and various other firms that deliver services to payment card issuers in the markets we serve, as well as financial institutions who provide such services in-house. Our competitors in this segment include, but are not limited to Fiserv, FIS, Marqeta, Nexi, Worldline, i2c, Bill.com, AvidExchange, Billtrust, Adyen, Stripe and Zeta.

What we can infer is that Global Payments Inc. operates in a highly competitive environment alongside major rivals like Fiserv, Worldpay, and emerging players such as Stripe. This intense competition suggests a few key implications for its financial performance and market share:\n\n1. Margin Pressure and Pricing Dynamics: With many competitors, including larger financial institutions and agile fintech companies, there is significant pressure on pricing. This competitive pressure could lead to tighter margins if Global Payments is forced to lower fees or invest more in technology to differentiate its offerings.\n\n2. Investment in Innovation and Technology: To maintain or improve its competitive positioning, Global Payments must continue to invest in technology and service enhancements. Such investments, while initially increasing operating expenses, are essential for capturing or defending market share over the long term.\n\n3. Market Penetration and Share Erosion Risks: The highly fragmented market and the entry of new competitors may limit the company’s ability to significantly increase its market share. Moreover, as competitors expand their services geographically or through product innovation, Global Payments may face challenges in retaining its current clientele, potentially impacting future revenue growth.\n\n4. Competitive Differentiation: The financial performance of Global Payments in the Merchant Solutions segment is closely tied to its ability to differentiate itself from rivals. This includes offering superior technology platforms, enhancing customer experience, and leveraging comprehensive solutions that add value beyond simple payment processing. Enhanced differentiation can help mitigate some of the competitive pressures and support stable or growing market share.\n\nIn summary, while hard figures aren’t provided in the data, Global Payments’ competitive positioning against firms like Fiserv, Worldpay, and Stripe likely leads to a trade-off between higher necessary investments and the risk of margin compression. The evolving competitive landscape means that preserving profitability and capturing market share will depend heavily on the effectiveness of its strategies in innovation, cost management, and customer service."

(“Splunk”), which contributed approximately $1.4 billion in total revenue for fiscal 2024. Within total revenue, product revenue decreased by 9% and services revenue increased by 5%. In fiscal 2024, total software revenue was $18.4 billion across all product areas and services, an increase of 9%, driven by the contribution of Splunk. Total subscription revenue increased 11%, partially driven by the contribution of Splunk.\nDuring the first nine months of fiscal 2024, we experienced a decline in product demand as customers continued to scrutinize spend as they needed additional time to implement elevated levels of product shipments received in prior quarters. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 we saw improvement in product demand across all geographic segments and customer markets as customers largely completed the installation of their product shipments. While we continue to operate in a highly competitive environment and the overall macroeconomic environment remains challenging and uncertain, we plan to continue to invest in key priority areas with the objective of driving profitable growth over the long term.\nTotal gross margin increased by 2.0 percentage points. Product gross margin increased by 2.0 percentage points, largely driven by favorable product mix, productivity benefits and benefits from Splunk, partially offset by negative impacts from pricing. As a percentage of revenue, research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses, collectively, increased by 4.4 percentage points. Operating income as a percentage of revenue decreased by 3.8 percentage points driven primarily by incremental operating expenses from Splunk, higher restructuring and other charges and higher amortization of purchased intangible assets in fiscal 2024. Diluted earnings per share decreased by 17%, driven by a decrease of 18% in net income partially offset by a decrease in diluted share count of 43 million shares.\nIn terms of our geographic segments, revenue from the Americas decreased by $1.5 billion, EMEA revenue decreased by $1.0 billion and revenue in our APJC segment decreased by $0.7 billion. We experienced a product revenue decline in the enterprise and service provider and cloud markets. Product revenue in the public sector market was flat. From a product category perspective, total product revenue decreased 9% year over year, driven by a decline in revenue in Networking of 15%, partially offset by growth in Security of 32% and Observability of 27%, each driven in large part by the contribution of Splunk. Product revenue grew in Collaboration by 2%.\nWe remain focused on delivering innovation across our technologies to assist our customers in executing on their digital transformations and on accelerating innovation across our portfolio. We believe that we are making progress on our strategic priorities."

      "ground_truth": "The decline in product revenue by 9% can primarily be attributed to two distinct dynamics across the product lines. First, the Networking segment experienced a steep 15% decline, which heavily weighed on overall product revenue. This decrease was driven by softer demand in key markets (enterprise, service provider, and cloud), as customers delayed or reduced spend, likely due to heightened scrutiny of expenditures in a challenging macroeconomic environment and the lingering effects of product shipments that had been elevated in prior periods. Second, the acquisitions—most notably that of Splunk Inc.—contributed positively to other product categories. Security and Observability saw strong growth (32% and 27% respectively), largely propelled by Splunk’s product contributions. However, despite these significant gains, the improvements in Security and Observability were insufficient to fully offset the negative impact from the Networking segment’s decline, resulting in a net decrease of 9% in overall product revenue. These factors together explain the divergent performance across product categories and the net revenue decline."

      "ground_truth": "The provided excerpt indicates that Broadridge operates in a highly competitive environment across multiple segments, including areas such as trade processing and back-office record keeping. While the data does not provide numerical or detailed capital allocation figures, we can infer several key points:\n\n1. Competitive Pressure and Capital Allocation: In segments where competition is intense—as evidenced by the presence of in-house operations and specialized third-party vendors—Broadridge is likely to prioritize investment in technology upgrades, innovation, and process efficiencies. This means a greater share of capital may be allocated toward enhancing the platform’s capability and reliability, ensuring the company maintains or grows its competitive edge.\n\n2. Investment Priorities and Strategic Initiatives: Given the competitive environment described, Broadridge may focus investments on areas that provide a distinct technological or service differentiation. This could include spending on research and development, digital transformation initiatives, and strategic partnerships. Such priorities not only support competitive positioning but also position the company to capitalize on market opportunities driven by evolving client needs.\n\n3. Impact on Future Growth and Valuation: The necessary capital investments in areas like trade processing and back-office record keeping have the potential to yield improvements in operational efficiency and customer service. In the medium to long term, successful focus on these areas could lead to enhanced growth prospects through an expanded client base and deeper market penetration. Improved performance metrics and prospects for sustained innovation can in turn boost the company’s valuation as investors recognize its strategic positioning.\n\nIn summary, the competitive dynamics in these segments are likely to compel Broadridge to allocate capital toward technological improvements and operational efficiencies. This strategic capital allocation, aimed at bolstering competitive differentiation, is expected to support future growth and potentially enhance the company’s overall market valuation."

      "ground_truth": "The provided data allows us to assess the relationship between the modest increase in dividends and the more robust improvement in diluted EPS. For instance, dividends per common share grew from $3.98 in 2022 to $4.06 in 2023, which is roughly a 2% increase. At the same time, the diluted EPS from continuing operations improved from $4.74 in 2022 to $5.35 in 2023 – an increase of about 13%. This contrast suggests that while Duke Energy has modestly raised its cash payouts, the underlying earnings performance has improved quite significantly.\n\nThis could indicate several important points about the company’s future capital allocation:\n\n1. Sustainability and Balance: The fact that dividend growth, though modest, is coupled with a marked improvement in EPS suggests that Duke Energy is generating stronger earnings and is in a better position to support its dividend policy. The modest dividend increase may reflect a cautious, sustainable approach, ensuring that payouts remain safe even as earnings grow.\n\n2. Flexibility for Reinvestment: The more pronounced EPS improvement likely provides Duke Energy with the flexibility to allocate additional capital for other strategic uses, such as investments in infrastructure, growth opportunities, or debt reduction. This balanced capital allocation can help maintain long-term growth while still rewarding shareholders.\n\n3. Confidence in Financial Strength: An improved EPS combined with rising dividends may be interpreted by investors as a signal of confidence in the company’s financial health and operational efficiency. Management appears willing to reward shareholders without jeopardizing the firm's ability to reinvest in the business.\n\nIn summary, the alignment of increasing dividend payouts with improving diluted EPS signals a careful balance between rewarding shareholders and retaining sufficient earnings to invest in future operations, highlighting a prudent approach to future capital allocation at Duke Energy."

Although the reserve data originates from the CNA disclosures, it is the only available reserve schedule, and the question is answerable using these figures. Regarding the impact on long‐term cash flow management for Loews Corporation, a significant portion (approximately $24,167 million) is scheduled for payment beyond 5 years. This concentration in the long-term period implies the following:\n\n• It reduces near-term liquidity pressures, as fewer cash outflows are expected in the short term.\n• However, it poses challenges for long-term planning because a substantial future cash commitment requires robust forecasting, disciplined long-term reserve management, and potentially strategic investment in assets that mature in a matching timeframe.\n• The company would need to ensure that it has or will generate the necessary funds over the long term, possibly affecting its capital allocation strategy and risk management framework. Market uncertainties—such as fluctuations in interest rates and inflation—could also affect the actual cost and timing of these outflows.\n\nIn summary, while the delayed payment schedule may ease immediate cash flow demands, Loews Corporation must carefully manage its long-term cash flows to ensure that the significant liability due in more than 5 years is adequately funded without compromising overall financial flexibility."

      "ground_truth": "Northern Trust’s emphasis on maintaining a strong, conservative balance sheet is a strategic risk management tool, particularly useful during periods of market volatility. Specifically, a strong balance sheet typically means the company has robust capital reserves, low leverage, and ample liquidity. This reduces financial risk in the following ways:\n\n1. **Reduced Leverage and Debt Servicing Risk**: By keeping leverage low, Northern Trust minimizes exposure to the risks associated with high levels of debt. In volatile markets, lower indebtedness means the firm is less sensitive to increases in borrowing costs and potential liquidity squeezes.\n\n2. **Adequate Liquidity**: A conservative balance sheet implies that the firm maintains sufficient liquid assets. This liquidity allows the company to meet short-term obligations without the need to sell assets at depressed values during downturns, thereby reducing the risk of forced liquidations in unfavorable market conditions.\n\n3. **Increased Financial Flexibility**: With a strong balance sheet, Northern Trust can respond to market disruptions more effectively. They can seize strategic opportunities such as mergers, acquisitions, or new investments without impeding their financial stability.\n\n4. **Enhanced Credit Profile**: A strong and conservative balance sheet contributes to a favorable credit rating. This, in turn, provides access to capital at competitive rates, which is particularly beneficial when markets are unstable, reducing the cost of capital even in turbulent times.\n\n5. **Investor and Client Confidence**: Maintaining balance sheet strength not only helps mitigate risk but also enhances trust among investors and clients. Confidence in the institution’s ability to navigate volatile markets can lead to more stable funding sources and client retention.\n\nOverall, these factors contribute to Northern Trust’s ability to preserve financial stability and make prudent strategic decisions during periods of market volatility, aligning with its goal of providing quality financial services and ensuring sustainable growth."

This represents approximately 11.25% of the total obligations, indicating that the vast majority of the obligations are due beyond the 12‐month horizon. The implication for Targa Resources Corp. is that while the company faces significant long-term liabilities, its near-term liquidity requirements are relatively moderate. The company’s assertion that it has sufficient liquidity suggests that it currently has the financial flexibility or access to liquidity resources to meet these short-term obligations as they come due. This is a positive signal regarding its short-term financial stability, though the management must continue to monitor and manage its liquidity position to ensure ongoing ability to support operations and meet obligations as they arise."

      "reference": [
        "The Company recognizes revenue from product sales when obligations under the terms of a contract with the customer are satisfied; generally, this occurs with the transfer of control of the goods to customers. The Company's global payment terms are typically between 30 to 90 days. Provisions for certain rebates, sales incentives, trade promotions, coupons, product returns, discounts to customers and governmental clawback provisions are accounted for as variable consideration and recorded as a reduction in sales.\nProduct discounts granted are based on the terms of arrangements with direct, indirect and other market participants, as well as market conditions, including consideration of competitor pricing. Rebates are estimated based on contractual terms, historical experience, patient outcomes, trend analysis and projected market conditions in the various markets served. The Company evaluates market conditions for products or groups of products primarily through the analysis of wholesaler and other third-party sell-through and market research data, as well as internally generated information.\nSales returns are estimated and recorded based on historical sales and returns information. Products that exhibit unusual sales or return patterns due to dating, competition or other marketing matters are specifically investigated and analyzed as part of the accounting for sales return accruals.\nSales returns allowances represent a reserve for products that may be returned due to expiration, destruction in the field, or in specific areas, product recall. The sales returns reserve is based on historical return trends by product and by market as a percent to gross sales. In accordance with the Company’s accounting policies, the Company generally issues credit to customers for returned goods. The Company’s sales returns reserves are accounted for in accordance with the U.S. GAAP guidance for revenue recognition when right of return exists. Sales returns reserves are recorded at full sales value. Sales returns in the Innovative Medicine segments are almost exclusively not resalable. Sales returns for certain franchises in the MedTech segment are typically resalable but are not material. The Company infrequently exchanges products from inventory for returned products. The sales returns reserve for the total Company has been less than 1.0% of annual net trade sales during the fiscal years 2023, 2022 and 2021.\nPromotional programs, such as product listing allowances are recorded in the same period as related sales and include volume-based sales incentive programs. Volume-based incentive programs are based on the estimated sales volumes for the incentive period and are recorded as products are sold. These arrangements are evaluated to determine the appropriate amounts to be deferred or recorded as a reduction of revenue. The Company also earns profit-share payments through collaborative arrangements of certain products, which are included in sales to customers. Profit-share payments were less than 2.0% of the total revenues in fiscal year 2023 and less than 3.0% of the total revenues in fiscal year 2022 and 2021 are included in sales to customers.\nIn addition, the Company enters into collaboration arrangements that contain multiple revenue generating activities. Amounts due from collaborative partners for these arrangements are recognized as each activity is performed or delivered, based on the relative selling price. Upfront fees received as part of these arrangements are deferred and recognized over the performance period. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional disclosures on collaborations.\nReasonably likely changes to assumptions used to calculate the accruals for rebates, returns and promotions are not anticipated to have a material effect on the financial statements. The Company currently discloses the impact of changes to assumptions in the quarterly or annual filing in which there is a material financial statement impact."

      "ground_truth": "The provided data describes how Johnson & Johnson establishes its sales returns reserves based on historical patterns, market research, and internal analyses, which sets the context for understanding the impact of changing market conditions. Changes in product lifecycle or competitive dynamics can affect future revenue estimates and profitability in the following ways:\n\n1. Product Lifecycle Changes: As a product matures or approaches the end of its lifecycle, patterns of usage and consumer behavior may change. For instance, products nearing obsolescence might see higher return rates or decreased demand because of newer alternatives. If historical trends no longer accurately predict returns for aging products, the sales returns reserve may be underestimated, potentially leading to overstatement of current revenue. Conversely, if a product is in its growth phase, returns might be lower if consumers are more satisfied or less likely to return items, possibly resulting in more favorable profitability.\n\n2. Competitive Dynamics: Increased competition can pressure companies to alter pricing strategies which often include higher rebates, discounts, or additional promotional allowances to maintain market share. Competitive dynamics might also lead to enhanced product features or improved customer service by rivals, prompting a need for Johnson & Johnson to adjust their allowances to maintain competitiveness. If competitors drive down prices and increase the use of incentives, the impact could be a downward adjustment of revenue on a net basis, thereby affecting both the overall revenue estimates and profitability. More generous or frequent sales incentives based on competitive pressures could also result in lower gross margins if not managed carefully.\n\nOverall, if historical data becomes less representative due to shifts in product lifecycle or increased competitive pressures, there is a risk that revenue could be overstated if future returns and promotional costs exceed those estimated. The company would then need to revise its assumptions and update the sales returns reserve calculations to better reflect the current market conditions, potentially leading to reduced future revenue estimates and profitability margins."

        "Substantially all of the supplemental health and life insurance policies the Company issues are classified as long-duration contracts. The contract provisions generally cannot be changed or canceled during the contract period; however, the Company may adjust premiums for supplemental health policies issued in the U.S. within prescribed guidelines and with the approval of state insurance regulatory authorities.\n\nInsurance premiums for most of the Company's health and life policies, including cancer, accident, hospital, critical illness, supplemental dental and vision, term life, whole life, long-term care and disability, are recognized as earned premiums over the premium-paying periods of the contracts when due from policyholders. When earned premiums are reported, the related amounts of benefits and expenses are charged against such revenues. This association is accomplished by means of annual increases or decreases to the liability for future policy benefits (LFPB) and the deferral and subsequent amortization of policy acquisition costs.\n\nPremiums from the Company's products with limited-pay features, including cancer, medical and nursing care, term life, whole life, WAYS, and child endowment, are collected over a significantly shorter period than the contract term (i.e., the period during which benefits are provided). Premiums for these products are recognized as earned premiums over the premium-paying periods when due from policyholders. Any gross premium in excess of the net premium is deferred and recorded as a deferred profit liability, which is subsequently amortized in net earned premiums such that profits are recognized in a constant relationship with insurance in force. Net premium is calculated as gross premium multiplied by the net premium ratio (NPR) and represents the portion of gross premium required to provide for benefits and expenses. Benefits are recorded as an expense when they are incurred. An LFPB is recorded when premiums are recognized using the net premium method.\n\nPolicyholders also have an option to pay discounted advanced premiums for certain of the Company's products. Advanced premiums are deferred and recognized when due from policyholders over the otherwise required contractual premium payment period.\n\nBenefit expense is bifurcated between benefits and claims and reserve remeasurement (gains) losses. The NPR is used to measure benefit expense and is calculated as the ratio of the present value of actual and future expected benefits and expenses to the present value of actual and future expected gross premiums. A revised NPR is calculated as of the beginning of each reporting period using updated future cash flow expectations.\n\nReserve remeasurement (gains) losses represent the difference between two reserve measures both calculated as of the beginning of the current reporting period using the same locked-in discount rates. One reserve measure uses the NPR as of the end of the prior reporting period, and the second uses the revised NPR. Benefits and claims represent the difference in the liability balance calculated as of the beginning of the current reporting period and the end of the current reporting period both using the revised NPR and the locked-in discount rates. The locked-in interest accretion rate utilized for accretion of interest expense on insurance reserves is the original discount rate used at contract issue date.\n\nAdvertising expense is reported as incurred in insurance and other expenses in the consolidated statements of earnings."

      "ground_truth": "The procedures affect earnings valuation by smoothing profit recognition over the life of the insurance contracts, rather than front-loading profits. Specifically, when gross premiums exceed the net premium required for benefits and expenses, the excess is recorded as a deferred profit liability. This deferral means that a portion of the profit is not immediately recognized in current earnings—instead, it is amortized over future periods in line with the policy’s coverage. Similarly, when policyholders pay discounted advanced premiums, these funds are not recognized immediately as revenue; they are deferred and then recognized over the contractual premium payment period. This treatment results in current earnings being lower because some of the premiums that could boost current profit are recorded as liabilities and deferred to future periods. Conversely, future earnings will benefit as the deferred amounts are gradually amortized, leading to a more constant relationship between the insurance in force and the profits recognized over time. This smoothing mechanism helps match revenues with the period in which the associated insurance risks occur and ensures that both current and future earnings provide a more accurate reflection of the economic performance of the underlying business."

        "FirstEnergy seeks to protect its customers, employees, facilities and the ongoing reliability of the electric system. FirstEnergy works closely with state and federal agencies and its peers in the electric utility industry to identify physical and cyber security risks, exchange information, and put safeguards in place to comply with strict reliability and security standards. From a security standpoint, the electric utility sector is one of the most regulated industries.\nRisk Management and Strategy\n\nFirstEnergy has established a broad framework to assess, identify and manage material risks from cyber security threats. This program is established at the executive level, with regular reporting to, and oversight by, the FE Board as described below. At the highest level, FirstEnergy’s program includes multi-layered governance by management, the Audit Committee, the Operations and Safety Committee, and the FE Board, as described in greater detail below.\n\nCentral management and coordination of the program helps FirstEnergy to comprehensively evaluate and protect against cyber threats. FirstEnergy’s policies and procedures identify how cyber security measures and controls are developed, implemented, and regularly reviewed and updated. FirstEnergy aims to align its cyber security program with national standards. For example, FirstEnergy has implemented and maintains a set of controls to manage cyber security risk based on the National Institute of Standards and Technology Cyber Security Framework and, for Bulk Electric System assets, the NERC Critical Infrastructure Protection standards. FirstEnergy also complies with various state laws and regulations on cyber security.\n\nFirstEnergy’s Cyber Security Program identifies security controls and user responsibilities for the organization to identify and manage the risk of a cyber security incident. FirstEnergy also conducts various internal and external risk assessments each year, which are based on nationally accepted standards. These can include annual compliance required assessments, such as requirements under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and Payment Card Industry compliance audits, as well as ad-hoc assessments driven by emerging risks, changes in FirstEnergy’s environment, or benchmark/roadmap needs. Risks identified in such assessments are considered for inclusion in FirstEnergy’s risk portfolio, or incorporated directly into the Cyber Security Program, and are then prioritized and addressed as needed through the organization’s policies and procedures. The risk assessment along with risk-based analysis and judgment are used to select security controls to address risks. During this process, the following factors, among others, are considered: likelihood and severity of risk, impact on FirstEnergy and others, such as vendors and customers, if a risk materializes, feasibility and cost of controls, and impact of controls on operations and others. FirstEnergy also regularly evaluates the adequacy and sufficiency of specific controls.\n\nTo further protect its information and cyber assets, FirstEnergy has required since late 2022 that applicable prospective third-party vendors complete a privacy impact assessment, which is designed to identify potential privacy and cyber security risks for those vendors requiring access to personally identifiable information, and based on the results, include appropriate contractual provisions to mitigate any identified risks. FirstEnergy is also currently evaluating its current third-party vendors to identify which vendors have similar access to personally identifiable information and expects to complete its analysis by the end of 2024.\n\nFirstEnergy conducts cyber security exercises and training. For example, all personnel with any form of computer system access must complete cyber security training on a recurring basis, which educates the personnel on FirstEnergy’s policies and procedures for using FirstEnergy systems, keeping FirstEnergy information secure, and for safe, reliable operation of electric utility systems. FirstEnergy also conducts various tests of its cyber incident response plans, disaster recovery plans and business continuity plans with key stakeholders and responders for various areas of FirstEnergy’s utility and business functions. FirstEnergy’s management also holds executive cyber security incident tabletop exercises to train on cyber security incident response.\n\nAdditionally, FirstEnergy leverages third-party security firms in various capacities to assist with various aspects of FirstEnergy’s cyber security program, including risk assessments, vulnerability scans, and penetration testing. FirstEnergy uses a variety of processes to address cyber security threats related to the use of third-party technology and services, such as reviewing independent assessments of the third party’s cyber/information security controls, such as Systems and Organization Controls 2 audits or other standards-based assessments, where appropriate. As part of FirstEnergy’s process to continuously improve its cyber and information security programs, FirstEnergy also engages third-party subject matter experts to assess and evaluate the effectiveness of various aspects of such programs.\n\nIn addition to the aforementioned efforts, FirstEnergy also strongly considers cyber security risks as a part of its overall strategy and invests heavily in sophisticated and layered security measures that use both technology and hard defenses to protect critical transmission facilities and its digital communications networks. For example, security enhancements to FirstEnergy’s transmission infrastructure, such as enhanced cyber security monitoring and alarming are a key component of FirstEnergy’s transmission investment program.\n\nDespite the security measures and safeguards FirstEnergy has employed, including certain measures implemented pursuant to mandatory NERC Critical Infrastructure Protection standards, FirstEnergy’s infrastructure may be increasingly vulnerable to such attacks as a result of the rapidly evolving and increasingly sophisticated means by which attempts to defeat security measures and gain access to information technology systems may be made. Also, FirstEnergy, or its vendors and service providers, may be at an increased risk of a cyber-attack and/or data security breach due to the nature of its business. Any such cyber incident could result in significant lost revenue, the inability to conduct critical business functions and serve customers for a significant period of time, the use of significant management resources, legal claims or proceedings, regulatory penalties, significant remediation costs, increased regulation, increased capital costs, increased protection costs for enhanced cyber security systems or personnel, damage to FirstEnergy's reputation and/or the rendering of its internal controls ineffective, all of which could materially adversely affect FirstEnergy's business, results of operations, financial condition and reputation.\n\nBoard Governance and Management\n\nThe FE Board has identified cyber security as a key enterprise risk and prioritizes the mitigation of this risk through FirstEnergy’s enterprise risk management process. Responsibility for oversight of risk management generally lies with the FE Board and the Audit Committee has primary responsibility to oversee enterprise risk management. To effectively manage oversight of FirstEnergy’s cyber security risk management practices, since 2022, the FE Board has delegated oversight authority to each of FirstEnergy’s Audit and Operations and Safety Committees, respectively, as detailed in each Committees’ charters. The Audit Committee has primary responsibility to oversee the disclosure of material cyber security incidents, as well as the general obligation to ensure the proper risk oversight structure of cyber security as part of the FirstEnergy’s overall enterprise risk management program and the internal controls applicable to cyber security matters. The Operations and Safety Oversight Committee has primary responsibility to oversee the operational aspects of FirstEnergy’s cyber security policies, programs, initiatives and strategies, as well as operational risk considerations related to cyber security matters. FirstEnergy’s CISO regularly provides reports at the Audit Committee, Operations and Safety Oversight Committee, and the full FE Board. Each such Committee and the full FE Board work collaboratively to ensure fulsome oversight with the proper focus of each respective Board body. These reports include, among other things, current and emerging cyber security risks to FirstEnergy, incidents that were escalated to management during the prior quarter, including those that did not require immediate escalation to the appropriate Committee and/or full FE Board, internal and external assessments of FirstEnergy’s cyber security program, and a roadmap of projects to manage its cyber security posture.\n\nAt the executive and management level, the CISO has primary responsibility for the development, operation, and maintenance of FirstEnergy’s cyber security program. The CISO has 5 years of experience in technology risk management, all of which have been with FirstEnergy, and an additional 23 years of experience in information technology. The CISO has passed examinations and received the International Information System Security Certification Consortium Certified Information Systems Security Professional certification. The CISO reports directly to FirstEnergy’s Chief Information Officer. Under the CISO’s oversight, FirstEnergy’s cyber security team implements and provides governance and functional oversight for cyber security controls and services. Cyber security processes include escalation of certain risks and incidents, including those that originate or occur at third parties, to the Chief Information Officer, legal, and the executive leaders as appropriate based on the severity of any such risk or incident. In addition, regular updates from the cyber security teams, in conjunction with real-time escalation on an as-needed basis, are also used to update the risk landscape.\n\nIn the event of any significant cyber security incident, FirstEnergy’s Cyber Security Incident Response Plan provides for a severity determination by a cyber security incident response team based on factors such as the number of assets affected, the likelihood of inappropriate data exposure, operational impact, reliability impact, and regulatory impact. Dependent upon the severity of an incident, it is FirstEnergy’s practice to escalate the incident to the Chief Information Officer, Chief Risk Officer, and the FE senior leadership team, including the Chief Legal Officer, Chief Financial Officer, and Chief Executive Officer. Such members of management then determine whether, based on various factors, the incident requires immediate escalation to the Audit and Operations and Safety Committees or full FE Board.\n\nAlthough the risks from cyber threats have not materially affected FirstEnergy’s business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition to date, FirstEnergy continues to closely monitor cyber risk. Overall, FirstEnergy has implemented tactical processes for assessing, identifying, and managing material risks from cyber security threats to FirstEnergy including governance at the executive and board level of FirstEnergy’s Cyber Security Program, including FE’s risk management strategy and the controls designed to protect its operations. Additionally, FirstEnergy, through its Disclosure Committee, has updated its disclosure controls and procedures to ensure appropriate disclosure of any material cyber security incidents. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for additional information regarding FirstEnergy’s cyber security risks. Those sections of Item 1A. Risk Factors should be read in conjunction with this Item 1C. Cybersecurity."

      "ground_truth": "The provided reference details how a significant cyber incident could adversely impact FirstEnergy’s cash flow and valuation in several ways, and it also outlines the company's risk management strategy. In terms of potential adverse scenarios, the reference identifies several key areas:\n\n1. Revenue and Operational Disruptions: A cyber incident might lead to lost revenue if critical business functions are disrupted or if the company is unable to serve customers effectively for an extended period. This could also lead to operational downtime and the inability to conduct critical business functions, directly impacting cash flow.\n\n2. Increased Costs and Capital Expenditures: Following a significant incident, FirstEnergy could face substantial remediation costs, legal fees, regulatory penalties, and higher expenses related to upgrading protection systems. This might include investments in enhanced cyber security systems, hiring additional experts, or even facing increased protection costs that can strain cash reserves and raise operating costs.\n\n3. Regulatory and Legal Consequences: Given the highly regulated nature of the electric utility sector, a cyber incident could trigger regulatory fines, increased oversight, or even litigation costs. Any legal proceedings or settlements would further drain financial resources and negatively affect valuation.\n\n4. Reputation and Market Confidence: A major cyber breach could damage FirstEnergy’s reputation, leading to a loss of customer trust and investor confidence. This reputational damage can reduce market value and dampen future cash flows if customers or business partners reduce their engagement with the company.\n\nRegarding the current risk management strategy, the reference outlines several key measures FirstEnergy employs:\n\n• Governance and Frameworks: The company has a multi-layered, governance-driven approach with executive level oversight, including regular reporting to the FE Board, the Audit Committee, and the Operations and Safety Oversight Committee. This ensures that cyber security is integrated into overall enterprise risk management.\n\n• Adoption of National Standards: FirstEnergy aligns its cyber security program with established frameworks like the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cyber Security Framework and NERC Critical Infrastructure Protection standards. These help ensure that formal best practices and compliance requirements are consistently met.\n\n• Regular Assessments and Testing: Internal and external risk assessments, vulnerability scans, penetration testing, and cyber security exercises help identify emerging threats and test the efficacy of the current measures, allowing the company to update and adapt its strategies as risks evolve.\n\n• Incident Response and Mitigation Planning: The company’s Cyber Security Incident Response Plan provides a clear escalation process and delineates responsibilities among senior leadership, ensuring rapid and effective responses to incidents to mitigate potential damage.\n\nIn summary, the potential negative scenarios for cash flow and valuation include lost revenue from operational disruptions, increased capital expenditure for remediation and upgrading systems, regulatory costs, and reputational damage. FirstEnergy’s strategy to address these risks is robust, involving strong governance, adherence to regulatory and industry standards, continuous assessments, and a well-defined incident response protocol that together aim to minimize the financial impacts of a potential cyber event."

        "The markets in which the Company conducts its business and the pharmaceutical industry in general are highly competitive and highly regulated. The Company’s competitors include other worldwide research-based pharmaceutical companies, smaller research companies with more limited therapeutic focus, generic drug manufacturers, and animal health care companies. The Company’s operations may be adversely affected by generic and biosimilar competition as the Company’s products mature, as well as technological advances of competitors, industry consolidation, patents granted to competitors, competitive combination products, new products of competitors, the generic availability of competitors’ branded products, and new information from clinical trials of marketed products or post-marketing surveillance. In addition, patent rights are increasingly being challenged by competitors, and the outcome can be highly uncertain. An adverse result in a patent dispute can preclude commercialization of products or negatively affect sales of existing products and could result in the payment of royalties or in the recognition of an impairment charge with respect to intangible assets associated with certain products.\nPharmaceutical competition involves a rigorous search for technological innovations and the ability to market these innovations effectively. With its long-standing emphasis on research and development, the Company is well-positioned to compete in the search for technological innovations. The Company is active in acquiring and marketing products through external alliances, such as licensing arrangements and collaborations and has been refining its sales and marketing efforts to address changing industry conditions. However, the introduction of new products and processes by competitors may result in price reductions and product displacements, even for products protected by patents. For example, the number of compounds available to treat a particular disease typically increases over time and can result in slowed sales growth or reduced sales of the Company’s products in that therapeutic category.\nThe highly competitive animal health business is affected by several factors including regulatory and legislative issues, scientific and technological advances, product innovation, the quality and price of the Company’s products as well as competitors’ products, effective promotional efforts and the frequent introduction of generic products by competitors."

      "ground_truth": "The reference material clearly outlines that Merck discloses several risks in its filings that can impact both its current financial results and future revenue prospects. Specifically, adverse outcomes in patent litigation or challenges—such as an unfavorable result in patent disputes—could lead Merck to record impairment charges on its intangible assets. This would occur if the market prospects of certain products diminish due to increased generic competition or technical innovations by competitors, resulting in lower expected future cash flows than previously estimated. Such impairment charges would appear on the income statement and would also be discussed in the notes to the financial statements, where management would outline the assumptions and uncertainties involved in valuing these intangible assets.\n\nIn terms of future revenue growth, the uncertainties arising from potential patent litigation and the competitive landscape are acknowledged as factors that could depress future sales growth. If patent disputes lead to the need to pay royalties, or if competition results in price reductions and product displacements, then the expected revenue from these products might be lower than forecasted. Although the reference does not provide specific numeric values or detailed financial figures, these qualitative disclosures offer investors insight into how litigation risks and competitive pressures are factored into Merck’s overall estimates of asset value and revenue forecasts.\n\nInvestors analyzing Merck’s financial statements should therefore review the impairment assessments on intangible assets and the relevant footnotes that discuss contingent liabilities and risk exposures related to litigation. This provides a framework for understanding how these uncertainties are built into the company’s financial outlook and future performance expectations."

      "ground_truth": "The data provided allows us to assess the relationship between increasing investments in R&D (research, development, and engineering expenses) and operating income over the three examined years. Here’s the breakdown:\n\n1. R&D Expenses (in millions):\n   • 2022: $2,771\n   • 2023: $3,102 (an increase of approximately 11.9% from 2022)\n   • 2024: $3,233 (an increase of about 4.2% from 2023)\n\n2. Operating Income (in millions):\n   • 2022: $7,788\n   • 2023: $7,654 (a slight decrease of approximately 1.7% from 2022)\n   • 2024: $7,867 (an increase of about 2.7% from 2023)\n\nAnalysis:\n• Over the three-year period, Applied Materials has consistently increased its R&D spending. However, the operating income did not show a consistent growth trend over the same period – it dipped slightly in 2023 before recovering in 2024.\n\n• The divergence indicates that while the company is investing more in innovation, this increase in R&D expenses has not been directly mirrored by proportional operating income growth in the short term. In fact, the significant jump in R&D spending between 2022 and 2023 (11.9%) coincided with a slight decrease in operating income, suggesting a lag effect where innovation investments may take longer to translate into higher operating earnings.\n\n• The data could suggest that the firm is adopting a strategy of prioritizing long-term competitive advantages and future revenue growth through innovation, even if the immediate impact on operating income appears muted. Sustainable innovation often requires upfront costs that may not result in immediate profitability improvements but are expected to bolster long-term competitive positioning and profitability.\n\nConclusion:\nApplied Materials’ increasing investment in R&D is a clear commitment to innovation. However, the operating income’s relatively stable performance with only slight fluctuations indicates that the benefits of these investments may be more long-term rather than showing a strong, direct short-term correlation. This analysis supports the view that while higher R&D spending is essential for future growth, its impact is not necessarily immediately reflected in operating income figures."

      "reference": [
        "2024 Acquisitions\nAcquisition of ESI Group SA\nOn November 3, 2023, we acquired 50.6% of the share capital of ESI Group SA (“ESI Group”) for $477 million, net of cash acquired, using existing cash. During January 2024, we completed the acquisition of the remaining share capital of ESI Group for $458 million, using existing cash. The company entered into put/call agreements valued at $7 million for certain ESI Group equity awards, subject to a holding period that may extend beyond the explicit vesting period, for the right to receive a cash payment equal to the public tender offer consideration of 155 euros per share, which was substantially paid in the third quarter of fiscal year 2024. For the year ended October 31, 2024, ESI Group's net revenue was $141 million and net loss attributable to Keysight shareholders was $68 million.\nThe ESI Group acquisition was accounted for in accordance with the authoritative accounting guidance. The acquired assets and assumed liabilities were recorded at their estimated fair values. We determined the estimated fair values with the assistance of valuations performed by third party specialists, discounted cash flow analysis, and estimates made by management. The acquisition of ESI Group expands our application layer portfolio with simulation capabilities that are critical to accelerate innovation in multiple end markets. These factors, among others, contributed to a purchase price in excess of the estimated fair value of ESI Group's net identifiable assets acquired (see summary of net assets below), and, as a result, we have recorded goodwill in connection with this transaction.\nGoodwill was assigned to the Communications Solutions Group (“CSG”) and the Electronic Industrial Solutions Group (“EISG”) reportable segments, based on the expected benefits and synergies that are likely to be realized from the ESI Group acquisition. We do not expect the goodwill recognized or any potential impairment charges in the future to be deductible for income tax purposes.\nA portion of the overall purchase price was allocated to acquired intangible assets. Amortization expense associated with acquired intangible assets is not deductible for tax purposes. Therefore, a deferred tax liability of $98 million was established primarily for the future amortization of these intangibles and is included in “other long-term liabilities” in the table below.\nThe following table summarizes the allocation of the purchase price to the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed on the closing date:\nNovember 3, 2023\n(in millions)\nCash and cash equivalents\t$\t35 \t\nShort-term investments\t12\nAccounts receivable\t28\nOther current assets\t18\nProperty, plant and equipment\t4\nOperating lease right-of-use assets\t8\nGoodwill\t603\nOther intangible assets\t494\nOther assets\t3\nTotal assets acquired\t1,205 \t\nAccounts payable\t(8)\t\nEmployee compensation and benefits\t(23)\t\nDeferred revenue\t(14)\t\nIncome and other taxes payable\t(11)\t\nOperating lease liabilities\t(3)\t\nOther accrued liabilities\t(18)\t\nDebt\t(24)\t\nRetirement and post-retirement benefits\t(7)\t\nLong-term operating lease liabilities\t(5)\t\nOther long-term liabilities\t(115)\t\nNet assets acquired\t$\t977 \t\n The fair values of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, accounts receivable, other current assets, accounts payable, employee compensation and benefits, and deferred revenue were generally determined using historical carrying values given the short-term nature of these assets and liabilities. The fair value for intangible assets was determined with the input from third-party valuation specialists. The fair values of property, plant and equipment and certain other liabilities were determined internally using historical carrying values and estimates made by management. During the second quarter of fiscal year 2024, the company decreased the deferred tax liability and goodwill by $8 million primarily for a timing difference in the recognition of research and development expenses. During the third quarter of fiscal year 2024, the company increased income and other taxes payable and other long-term liabilities by $3 million and $5 million, respectively, offset against goodwill, primarily for tax liabilities and uncertain tax positions.\nValuation of Intangible Assets Acquired\nThe components of intangible assets acquired in connection with the ESI Group acquisition were as follows:\nEstimated Fair Value\t\tEstimated useful life\t\tValuation Method\n(in millions)\t\t(in years)\t\t\nDeveloped technology\t$\t270 \t\t\t6\t\tMulti-period excess earnings\nCustomer relationships\t160\t\t6\t\tWith and without\nBacklog\t15\t\t3\t\tMulti-period excess earnings\nTrademarks/Tradename\t2\t\t2\t\tRelief from royalty\nTotal amortizable intangible assets\t447\t\t\t\t\nIn-process research and development\t47\t\t\t\tMulti-period excess earnings\nTotal intangible assets\t$\t494 \t\t\t\t\t\n \nAs noted above, the intangible assets were valued using different income approach methods. The significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value of the acquired intangible assets included revenue growth rates, earnings before interest and taxes, customer attrition rate, discount rate, obsolescence rate and total operating expenses. The in-process research and development was valued by discounting forecasted cash flows directly related to the products expecting to result from the projects, net of returns on contributory assets. A discount rate of 12% was used to value the research and development projects to reflect the additional risks inherent in the acquired projects. The primary in-process projects acquired relate to next generation products which will be released in the near future. Total costs to complete for all ESI Group in-process research and development were estimated at approximately $7 million as of the close date.\nAcquisition and integration costs directly related to the ESI Group acquisition were recorded in research and development, selling, general and administrative, other operating expense (income), net and other income (expense), net and were $39 million for the year ended October 31, 2024. For the year ended October 31, 2024, we incurred $10 million of acquisition-related compensation expense to redeem certain of ESI Group's outstanding unvested stock awards as of the date of the acquisition that were determined to relate to post-merger service periods.\nAcquisition of Riscure Holding B.V.\nOn February 21, 2024, we acquired all the outstanding share capital of Riscure Holding B.V. (“Riscure”) for $78 million, net of cash acquired, expanding our automated security assessment capabilities and solutions for semiconductors, embedded systems, and connected devices. We recognized goodwill and other intangible assets of $52 million and $35 million, respectively, based on the preliminary allocation of the purchase price to the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Goodwill was assigned to the CSG reportable segment, based on the expected benefits and synergies that are likely to be realized from the Riscure acquisition. We do not expect the goodwill recognized or any potential impairment charges in the future to be deductible for income tax purposes.\nAcquisition of AnaPico AG\nOn June 12, 2024, we acquired all the outstanding share capital of AnaPico AG (“AnaPico”) for $117 million, net of cash acquired, accelerating our strategy to expand our customer base in commercial communications, automotive, aerospace, defense, and government markets. We recognized goodwill and other intangible assets of $60 million and $53 million, respectively, based on the preliminary allocation of the purchase price to the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The identified intangible assets primarily consist of developed technology of $28 million, customer relationships of $12 million, backlog of $1 million and in-process research and development of $12 million. The estimated useful lives of developed technology is 9 years, customer relationships is 9 years and backlog is 1 year.

In the acquisition, the purchase price allocation resulted in a recorded goodwill of $603 million and other intangible assets of $494 million. These figures increased the overall asset base on the balance sheet, although the net identifiable assets were valued at $977 million after liabilities. Key valuation assumptions that played a critical role in these estimates include:\n\n1. Valuation methods and inputs for intangible assets – the fair values were determined using techniques like discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis, multi‐period excess earnings methods, and relief from royalty approaches. Inputs such as revenue growth rates, earnings before interest and taxes, customer attrition rates, obsolescence rates, and total operating expenses were critical.\n\n2. Specifically for in-process research and development, a discount rate of 12% was used to reflect the additional risks inherent in these projects.\n\n3. Allocation of the purchase price in excess of the net identifiable fair values to goodwill – this reflects the anticipated synergies and future benefits from the acquisition, despite the fact that neither the goodwill nor any potential future impairment charges are expected to be tax deductible.\n\nThus, the recognition of these assets had a significant impact on Keysight’s balance sheet by increasing both intangible asset values and goodwill, underpinning expectations of future revenue synergies while also incorporating critical judgment regarding revenue forecasts, cost estimates, and risk premiums in the valuation process."

        "Cybersecurity Risk Management and Strategy\nOur global reach and the ever-evolving threat landscape makes data security and privacy a critical priority for us. Our Director of Cybersecurity and Technology Risk Management and their global cybersecurity team reports to our Chief Technology Officer and together, they are responsible for our network security, cybersecurity risk management processes, and business continuity. This team partners with leaders from all of our global regions to align our cybersecurity risk management processes and strategic goals with our business priorities and to ultimately mitigate cybersecurity risk at C.H. Robinson.\nOur global cybersecurity team has experience and expertise supporting mitigation of the potential cybersecurity threats facing our organization and vulnerabilities facing our technology infrastructure and potential cybersecurity threats. Our Director of Cybersecurity and Technology Risk Management has over a decade of experience leading cyber security oversight, and others on our global cybersecurity team have cybersecurity experience or certifications, such as the Certified Information Systems Security Professional, CompTIA, Offensive Security Certified Professional, Certificate of Cloud Security Knowledge, Global Information Assurance Certification (“GIAC”), Certified Incident Handler certifications. We view cybersecurity as a shared responsibility, and we periodically perform simulations and tabletop exercises at a management level and incorporate external resources and advisors as needed. All employees are required to complete cybersecurity trainings at least once a year and have access to more frequent cybersecurity trainings. We also require employees in certain roles to complete additional role-based, specialized cybersecurity trainings. Program performance is reported to and monitored by senior leadership and the Audit Committee on a quarterly basis.\nThe Company maintains an Enterprise Risk Management (“ERM”) program, which includes processes for key risk identification, mitigation efforts, and day-to-day management of risks, including cybersecurity risks. The ERM program is administered by our Internal Audit department and involves our global cybersecurity team, which possesses significant knowledge and expertise in the area of cybersecurity risks.Our global cybersecurity team ensures the cybersecurity risks identified from the ERM program are incorporated into our overall cybersecurity program. Programs to address key cybersecurity risks have been put into place including layered coverage with focus areas and practices designed to address network and endpoint security, application security, and security operations. We also employ automated detection and event correlation techniques and alerting as well as integrate cyber threat intelligence into our processes. Our security operations center serves as the front line of these alerts and investigates and remediates threats as necessary. Although it is difficult to determine the potential impacts from a cybersecurity incident, we may experience negative impacts such as reputational harm, inability to retain existing customers or attract new customers, exposure to legal claims and government action, among others. Previous attacks on our operating systems have not had a material financial impact on our operations, but we cannot guarantee future attacks will have little to no impact on our business. Furthermore, given the interconnected nature of the supply chain and our significant presence in the industry, we believe we may be an attractive target for such attacks. The impact of a cybersecurity incident may have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations, availability of our systems, and growth prospects, which makes cybersecurity risk management of critical importance to our organization.\nAlthough we have internally developed the majority of our line of business applications, we also rely on technology provided by third parties. We have processes in place to oversee and identify risks from cybersecurity threats associated with the use of third-party technology including third-party risk management, process and partner intake risk assessments, and dedicated procurement functions. These processes help mitigate the risks associated with utilizing external technology platforms and help prevent disruptions to our business operations.\nWe also involve external cybersecurity experts to assess our cybersecurity program, risk management, and relevant internal controls. In addition to our cybersecurity programs and policies, the Company also purchases a cybersecurity risk insurance policy to limit its exposure to cybersecurity incidents.\nWe have processes and programs in place to meet our global compliance obligations and work with our employees and teams across the globe to ensure security and data protection principles are integrated into the way we do business every day. We utilize a set of controls that integrate guidance from the EU’s General Data Protection Regulations and align with the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology’s (“NIST”) framework. We undergo a regular independent assessment of our operational and strategic maturity across NIST controls and summary performance is shared with senior leadership including our board of directors. In addition, we submit to independent assessments by external parties, including System and Organizational Controls (“SOC”) 2 Type 2 audits, covering customer-facing and line-of-business applications to ensure all safeguards function as they should. These functions are also supported by internal compliance teams who perform additional layers of testing prior to SOC 2 Type 2 procedures.\nOur Technology Continuity program follows industry standards for disaster recovery practices, including close alignment with ISO 27031:2011 and the Disaster Recovery Institute International’s Professional Practices. Our program includes multiple components that act as an additional line of defense—among them are regular functional recovery and tabletop exercises; cybersecurity exercises; protected backups for critical data; recovery time objectives; and recovery point objectives including achievability metrics, application criticality tiering, program audit and maintenance, awareness and training, business impact analysis, and risk evaluation and controls.\nCybersecurity Governance\nThe Board of Directors is tasked with oversight of the Company’s cybersecurity, information governance, and privacy programs. The Audit Committee oversees our ERM program and receives semi-annual ERM updates, which include cyber-related risk items. In addition, our Audit Committee receives quarterly reports on cybersecurity from our Chief Technology Officer and our Director of Cybersecurity and Technology Risk Management. Our Director of Cybersecurity and Technology Risk Management and their global cybersecurity team has experience and expertise supporting mitigation of the potential cybersecurity threats facing our organization and vulnerabilities facing our technology infrastructure and potential cybersecurity threats.\nWe have also established a cross-functional project team of subject matter experts from across the organization to quickly analyze, mitigate, and remediate potential cybersecurity incidents or vulnerabilities and comply with cybersecurity related reporting requirements. The details of any such cybersecurity incidents or threats are included in the quarterly reports to the Audit Committee."

      "ground_truth": "The reduction in long‐term debt from $3,013,241 in 2022 to $2,611,069 in 2023—a decrease of approximately $402 million or about 13.3%—can have several positive implications for Steel Dynamics’ leverage and overall financial risk profile. A lower long‐term debt level generally reduces the company’s leverage ratios (such as debt-to-equity), which in turn can decrease financial risk. With less reliance on debt financing, Steel Dynamics would be less exposed to interest rate fluctuations and have a lower interest expense burden, thereby improving its profitability. Additionally, a stronger balance sheet with reduced debt may enhance the company’s creditworthiness, potentially leading to better access to capital at more favorable rates in the future. Overall, this reduction suggests an improvement in financial flexibility and a decrease in the risk associated with high leverage."

        "Cybersecurity litigation, claims, and investigations. In September 2023, through unauthorized access to certain of its U.S. systems, third-party criminal actors obtained, for some of the Company’s customers, personal information (including name, contact information (such as phone number, email address and postal address), gender, date of birth and driver’s license numbers). For a limited number of customers, Social Security numbers and passport numbers were also obtained by the criminal actors. The Company has been and continues to notify individuals impacted by this issue in accordance with federal and state law.\n\nIn connection with this cybersecurity issue, the Company became subject to consumer class actions in U.S. federal and state courts. These class actions assert a variety of common law and statutory claims based on allegations that the Company failed to use reasonable security procedures and practices to safeguard customers’ personal information, and seek monetary and statutory damages, injunctive relief and other related relief. In addition, the Company is the subject of investigations by state and federal regulators, which also could result in monetary fines and other relief. The Company cannot predict the timing or outcome of any of these potential matters, or whether the Company may be subject to additional legal proceedings, claims, regulatory inquiries, investigations, or enforcement actions. While the Company believes it is reasonably possible that it may incur losses associated with the above-described proceedings, it is not possible to estimate the amount of loss or range of loss, if any, that might result from adverse judgments, settlements, or other resolution given the preliminary stage of these proceedings. The Company has incurred, and expects to continue to incur, certain expenses related to the cybersecurity issue, including expenses to respond to, remediate, and investigate this matter. The full scope of the costs and related impacts of this issue, including the extent to which all of the costs will be offset by cybersecurity insurance, has not been determined.\n\nOther litigation. The Company is a party to various other legal proceedings, most of which relate to routine matters incidental to its business. Management does not believe that the outcome of such proceedings will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows."

The quoted reference indicates that while the extent to which costs will be covered by insurance has not yet been determined, the presence of such coverage is aimed at reducing the financial impact of these legal issues.\n\nFurthermore, changes in coverage—such as reductions or limitations in the scope or amount of cybersecurity insurance—could directly affect MGM’s risk profile. A decrease in coverage would likely mean that a larger share of any losses would have to be borne by the company, thereby increasing its exposure to financial risks related to cybersecurity events. Conversely, improved or broadened coverage could lessen the company’s net exposure and provide stronger financial protection, thereby reducing overall risk. In essence, cybersecurity insurance acts as a financial buffer; its stability and adequacy are critical in managing MGM’s risk in the event of another cybersecurity incident."

        "We rely on information systems in our business to obtain, rapidly process, analyze, manage and store customer,product, supplier and employee data to, among other things: maintain and manage multiple information systemsworldwide to facilitate the purchase and distribution of thousands of inventory items from numerous distributioncenters; receive, process and ship orders on a timely basis; manage the accurate billing and collections forthousands of customers; process payments to suppliers and vendors; provide products and services that maintaincertain of our customers’ electronic medical or dental records (including protected health information of theirpatients) and maintain and manage global human resources, compensation and payroll systems. For these purposes,we define “information systems” in a manner consistent with the definition contained in the new rules recentlyadopted by the SEC to mean “electronic information resources, owned or used by the registrant, including physicalor virtual infrastructure controlled by such information resources, or components thereof, organized for thecollection, processing, maintenance, use, sharing, dissemination, or disposition of the registrant's information tomaintain or support the registrant's operations.” Cybersecurity Risk Management and Strategy We have developed and implemented a cybersecurity risk mitigation strategy intended to protect our informationsystems. Our cybersecurity risk mitigation strategy is designed so that the Company’s cybersecurity program isaligned with generally accepted cybersecurity standards and frameworks, in particular the NIST CybersecurityFramework, or “NIST CSF,” and our Company is externally audited, or certified, with ISO27001 partial scope. We maintain an Office of Cybersecurity (“OCS”), led by our Chief Information Security Officer (“CISO”), whichoversees the operations of our cyber risk mitigation strategy. The OCS is a cross-functional, enterprise-widemanagement team, which continuously evaluates our global cybersecurity program’s effectiveness and is focusedon maintaining and protecting our information systems. In overseeing the operations of our cyber risk mitigation strategy, the OCS partners with our Global Technology Solutions team, which is led by our Chief TechnologyOfficer (“CTO”) and is comprised of over one hundred professionals that support our information systems andoperations. Our cyber risk mitigation strategy includes monitoring for and addressing risks that materialize withinthe Company’s information systems, as well as at our third-party vendors, suppliers and other third-party businesspartners. Our CISO reports to our CTO. Our CTO, who also serves as Senior Vice President, has more than 30 years ofexperience leading large-scale global IT organizations and received a Bachelor of Business Administration inBusiness Computer Information Systems and a Master of Business Administration from Hofstra University. SeealsoItem 1. Business, Other Executive Management. Our Vice President, Global CISO, who also serves as VicePresident and Head of the Office of Cyber Security, is a National Security Agency Certified Information SystemsSecurities Engineer, has nearly 30 years of experience leading global cybersecurity programs, and received a BS,Electrical Engineering and Computer Science from Lafayette College, and a Master of Science, Business,Information Technology Management from Johns Hopkins University. The cybersecurity risk mitigation strategyis also overseen by senior managers who are members of our Executive Steering Committee, comprised of theCompany’s most senior technology, legal and internal auditing officers. Our CEO is regularly briefed on issues,incidents, and developments, and our Board oversees our risk mitigation strategy principally through its AuditCommittee and Regulatory, Compliance and Cybersecurity Committee, as described in more detail below. Our cybersecurity risk management program includes, among other elements:●risk assessments designed to help identify material cybersecurity risks to our information systems;●a security team principally responsible for managing our (i) cybersecurity risk assessment processes, and(ii) defining cybersecurity control standards;●the use of expert external service providers to assess, test or otherwise assist with aspects of ourcybersecurity controls, and to respond to specific cybersecurity threats;●the review and assessment of past cybersecurity incidents with a view to learning from those events tofurther strengthen our cyber risk mitigation strategy;●a written cybersecurity incident response plan that includes procedures for responding to cybersecurityincidents; and●a Global Information Security Policy, together with more detailed information security policies,procedures, standards, and guidelines.In addition, all employees with systems access are required to participate in mandatory annual cybersecurity andanti-phishing courses, along with compliance programs. Our employees who perform financial gatekeeper rolesalso receive additional mandatory annual data security training specific to spoofing, phishing and similar datasecurity threats. Per written Company policies, employees are also required to safeguard confidential information. Our cybersecurity risk strategy is integrated into our overall enterprise risk management program, and ourcybersecurity team is supported by and connected with the enterprise risk management team. Prior Cybersecurity Incidents In addition to immaterial and unrelated prior incidents at certain of our subsidiaries, in October 2023 Henry Scheinexperienced a cybersecurity incident that primarily affected the operations of our North American and Europeandental and medical distribution businesses. Henry Schein One, our practice management software, revenue cyclemanagement and patient relationship management solutions business, was not affected, and our manufacturingbusinesses were mostly unaffected. Once we became aware of the issue, we took steps to assess, contain andremediate this incident. We restored affected systems and applications, our distribution operations resumed and wereactivated our ecommerce platform. We also notified law enforcement and our employees, customers, suppliersand investors, informing them of both the incident and management’s efforts to mitigate its impact on our dailyoperations and data maintained on the Company’s systems. Subsequently, on or about November 8, 2023, wedetermined that the threat actor obtained personal and sensitive information maintained on our systems belonging tocertain third parties and since that date we have notified affected and potentially affected parties as appropriate. The scope of personal and sensitive data impacted is still under investigation. On November 22, 2023, weexperienced a related disruption to our ecommerce platform and related applications, which has since beenremediated. As described in “Management’s Discussion & Analysis – 2023 Compared to 2022, the incidentadversely impacted our financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2023. We also expect some short-termresidual impact on our financial results in 2024. It is part of the mission of our cybersecurity risk mitigation strategy to constantly evolve our cybersecurity defensesto adapt to evolving risks, and to learn from prior incidents, and we have evaluated and continue to evaluate theincident with the assistance of third-party expert consultants. Members of the Audit Committee and Regulatory,Compliance and Cybersecurity Committee of our Board of Directors are conducting a review of the October 2023cybersecurity incident, including the measures undertaken in response to the incident. Cybersecurity Governance Our Board has a Regulatory, Compliance and Cybersecurity Committee that focuses on cybersecurity oversight,together with other board committees, principally the Audit Committee. The purpose of the Regulatory,Compliance and Cybersecurity Committee is to assist the Board by providing guidance to, and oversight of, theCompany’s senior management responsible for assessing and managing Company-wide regulatory, corporatecompliance and cybersecurity risk management programs. The primary responsibilities of the Regulatory,Compliance and Cybersecurity Committee are to (i) discuss cybersecurity strategic decisions, issues, challenges andopportunities relating thereto, (ii) provide expertise to guide assessment and monitoring of Company-wideregulatory, corporate compliance and cybersecurity risk management budgeting, spending and capital investment,(iii) monitor progress and status of the Company’s regulatory, corporate compliance and cybersecurity riskmanagement programs, (iv) review and evaluate major regulatory, corporate compliance and cybersecurity riskmanagement initiatives to identify emerging and future opportunities for synergy or to leverage regulatory,corporate compliance and cybersecurity risk management investments more effectively and cost efficiently,(v) report to the Audit Committee on regulatory, corporate compliance and cybersecurity risk management mattersreviewed by the Regulatory, Compliance and Cybersecurity Committee that may impact the Company’s financialreporting and (vi) be generally available to, and communicate with, the Company’s senior management, and toinform the Board in the areas described above.Our CISO and CTO, along with other key executives who are part of our Executive Steering Committee, reviewstrategy, policy, program effectiveness, standards, enforcement and cybersecurity issue management with theBoard’s Regulatory, Compliance and Cybersecurity Committee on at least a quarterly basis and with the AuditCommittee on at least a bi-annual basis.

The CTO, as the head of the Global Technology Solutions team, is responsible for overseeing the overall information systems and technology infrastructure. This role ensures that the company’s technology systems are aligned with current industry standards, support global operations, and are capable of rapidly responding to security incidents. In contrast, the CISO, who leads the cybersecurity strategy and is part of the Office of Cybersecurity (OCS), focuses specifically on identifying, assessing, and mitigating cybersecurity risks. The CISO is responsible for developing security policies, managing risk assessments, and coordinating incident response strategies, all while ensuring adherence to accepted frameworks such as the NIST Cybersecurity Framework and ISO27001 standards.\n\nThis structured approach—with the CTO managing the broader technology operations and the CISO concentrating on cybersecurity risk mitigation—creates a layered defense that enhances the company’s ability to manage potential financial and operational risks. On the financial side, proactive cybersecurity governance helps to mitigate potential losses from data breaches or other information system disruptions, which could otherwise adversely impact the company's quarterly and annual results. On the operational side, this clear delineation of responsibilities ensures that cybersecurity measures are integrated into overall risk management processes, minimizing interruptions to critical business functions such as billing, collections, and order processing. Furthermore, the governance structure promotes regular executive oversight and cross-functional communication (with the integration of both roles into the Executive Steering Committee and Board-level committees), ensuring that emerging threats are swiftly identified and addressed, thus safeguarding both financial performance and operational continuity."

This could suggest several interpretations regarding the company's valuation and market conditions:\n\n1. It may indicate that the market valuation of Aflac Incorporated has increased over these periods, leading to higher prices when repurchasing shares.\n2. The rising repurchase prices could reflect more bullish market sentiment or possibly a narrowing of the discount between the share repurchase price and the market price.\n3. The trend may also reveal that the company is willing to invest more when buying back its shares, which could be interpreted by the market as a vote of confidence in its future prospects.\n\nThus, the upward trend in the repurchase price per share reflects improving company valuation or stronger market conditions during these periods."

        "Addressing cybersecurity risks is a priority for us. We have in place systems of internal controls as well as business continuity and disaster recovery plans, and we regularly perform assessments of these systems and plans to address cybersecurity and technology. Our cybersecurity program has been developed based on industry standards set by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (\"NIST\") and includes a comprehensive set of security policies and procedures that guide our protection strategy against threats by utilizing the following measures: identifying critical assets and high-risk threats; implementing cybersecurity detection, controls, and remediation practices; implementing a third-party risk management program to evaluate our cyber position; and, evaluating our cybersecurity program effectiveness by performing both internal and external testing and auditing risk.\nIn addition to a dedicated information technology cybersecurity team monitoring our daily operations, we annually assess our cybersecurity program against the NIST framework and engage outside security firms to conduct penetration tests and assist with monitoring of daily operations. We require annual cybersecurity awareness training for all of our employees to aid in promptly identifying and reporting potential or actual issues. Additionally, our dedicated information technology cybersecurity team undertakes regular robust cybersecurity training to increase cybersecurity awareness, internal expertise, and readiness efforts. We install and regularly update antivirus software on all Company managed systems and workstations in an effort to detect and prevent malicious code. We conduct ongoing security breach and phishing simulations to raise awareness of various critical security threats. Periodically, we run tabletop exercises involving members of the Company's management team intended to simulate a response to a cybersecurity incident and use the findings to improve our policies and procedures. All third-party service providers or vendors utilized as part of the Company’s cybersecurity framework are required to comply with our policies regarding non-public personal information and information security.\nOur cybersecurity program is led by our Senior Vice President - Strategic Services and Chief Information Officer (\"CIO\"). Our CIO also serves as the Chair of our Cybersecurity Executive Oversight Committee (\"CEOC\"), comprised of senior executives representing various teams and functions of the Company including legal, finance, accounting, investor relations, and operations. The CEOC supports efforts to evaluate the materiality of any incidents, determines whether notice to third parties such as residents or vendors is required, and determine whether any disclosures to stakeholders are required. The CEOC is also responsible for ensuring the Company's management and Board of Trust Managers (\"Board\") are fully aware of key activities and events associated with our cybersecurity program on an ongoing basis.\nAlthough our entire Board is actively involved in overseeing risk management, the Audit Committee charter tasks the Audit Committee with providing oversight of management's guidelines and policies to govern the process by which risk assessments and risks are managed, including the Company’s major financial risk exposures and the steps management has taken to monitor and control such exposures. The Audit Committee also discusses with management the processes undertaken to evaluate our systems of disclosure controls and procedures, including those relating to cybersecurity risk management. Our CIO reports quarterly to the Audit Committee and Board regarding cybersecurity matters, which includes emerging cybersecurity threats and the risk landscape, updates on our cybersecurity program and related readiness, resiliency, and response efforts.\nLike other businesses, we have been, and expect to continue to be, subject to attempts on unauthorized access, mishandling or misuse, computer viruses or malware, cyber-attacks and intrusions and other events of varying degrees. To date, we have not experienced a cybersecurity breach nor are we aware of any of our third-party outside service providers experiencing a cybersecurity breach."

Risk Mitigation: By implementing robust internal controls, continuous monitoring, and comprehensive disaster recovery plans, Camden Property Trust minimizes the likelihood of a breach. This proactive risk management framework decreases the operational risk and potential financial impacts that a cyber breach could incur (e.g., remediation costs, legal liabilities, and reputational harm).\n\n2. Investor Confidence: Maintaining a strong cybersecurity record reassures investors and stakeholders that the company is well-prepared to counter cyber threats. This increased confidence can contribute to a higher overall market valuation as the company’s risk profile is perceived as lower.\n\n3. Operational Continuity and Resilience: Regular assessments of cybersecurity systems, penetration testing by third parties, and ongoing training help to ensure that the company can quickly identify and remediate vulnerabilities. This means that even if an attempt is made, the company is well-positioned to respond without significant disruption to its operations or its core cash flows.\n\n4. Board and Executive Oversight: The involvement of high-level executives and the Audit Committee in cybersecurity oversight creates accountability and ensures that any emerging risks are promptly addressed. This governance structure further strengthens the company’s risk management profile and supports strategic decision-making, which is key in maintaining valuation.\n\nIn summary, Camden Property Trust’s comprehensive cybersecurity framework not only protects its assets from potential cyber threats but also enhances its reputation and operational stability. These factors together help in preserving the company’s overall valuation."

        "We follow a five-step model for revenue recognition. The five steps are: (1) identification of the contract(s) with the customer, (2) identification of the performance obligation(s) in the contract(s), (3) determination of the transaction price, (4) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligation(s), and (5) recognition of revenue when (or as) each performance obligation is satisfied. Control of our products transfers to our customers when the customer is able to direct the use of, and obtain substantially all of the benefits from, our products, which occurs at the later of when title or risk of loss transfers to the customer. Control generally transfers to the customer at a point in time upon loading of our product onto transportation equipment or delivery to a customer destination. Revenue from forward sales programs is recognized on the same basis as other sales regardless of when the customer advances are received.\nIn situations where we have agreed to arrange delivery of the product to the customer’s intended destination and control of the product transfers upon loading of our product, we have elected to not identify delivery of the product as a performance obligation. We account for freight income associated with the delivery of these products as freight revenue, since this activity fulfills our obligation to transfer the product to the customer. Shipping and handling costs incurred by us are included in cost of sales.\nWe offer cash incentives to certain customers based on the volume of their purchases over a certain period. Customer incentives are reported as a reduction in net sales.",
        "Our performance obligations under a customer contract correspond to each shipment of product that we make to our customer under the contract. As a result, each contract may have more than one performance obligation based on the number of products ordered, the quantity of product to be shipped and the mode of shipment requested by the customer. When we enter into a contract with a customer, we are obligated to provide the product in that contract during a mutually agreed upon time period. Depending on the terms of the contract, either we or the customer arranges delivery of the product to the customer’s intended destination. When we arrange delivery of the product and control of the product transfers upon loading, we recognize freight revenue, which was $92 million for 2023, $91 million for 2022, and not material for 2021.\nCertain of our contracts require us to supply products on a continuous basis to the customer. We recognize revenue on these contracts based on the quantity of products transferred to the customer during the period. For 2023, 2022 and 2021, the total amount of revenue for these contracts was $61 million, $65 million and $92 million, respectively.\nFrom time to time, we will enter the marketplace to purchase product in order to satisfy the obligations of our customer contracts. When we purchase product for this purpose, we are the principal in the transaction and recognize revenue on a gross basis. As discussed in Note 10—Equity Method Investment, we have transactions in the normal course of business with PLNL, reflecting our obligation to purchase 50% of the ammonia produced by PLNL at current market prices. Other than products purchased from PLNL, products purchased in the marketplace in order to satisfy the obligations of our customers were not material during 2023 and 2022, and $68 million for 2021.\nTransaction Price\nWe agree with our customers on the selling price of each transaction. This transaction price is generally based on the product, market conditions, including supply and demand balances, freight arrangements including where control transfers, and customer incentives. In our contracts with customers, we allocate the entire transaction price to the sale of product to the customer, which is the basis for the determination of the relative standalone selling price allocated to each performance obligation. Any sales tax, value added tax, and other tax we collect concurrently with our revenue-producing activities are excluded from revenue. Returns of our product by our customers are permitted only when the product is not to specification. Returns were not material during 2023, 2022 or 2021.\nWe offer cash incentives to certain customers generally based on the volume of their purchases over the fertilizer year ending June 30. Our cash incentives do not provide an option to the customer for additional product. Accrual of these incentives involves the use of estimates, including how much product the customer will purchase and whether the customer will achieve a\ncertain level of purchases within the incentive period. The balances of customer incentives accrued at December 31, 2023 and 2022 were not material.\nRevenue Disaggregation\nWe track our revenue by product and by geography. See Note 22—Segment Disclosures for our revenue by reportable segment, which are Ammonia, Granular Urea, UAN, AN and Other. The following table summarizes our revenue by product and by geography (based on destination of our shipment) for 2023, 2022 and 2021:\n \tAmmonia\t\tGranular\nUrea\t\tUAN\t\tAN\t\tOther\t\tTotal\n \t(in millions)\nYear ended December 31, 2023\t \t\t \t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t \nNorth America\t$\t1,387 \t\t\t$\t1,767 \t\t\t$\t1,646 \t\t\t$\t253 \t\t\t$\t486 \t\t\t$\t5,539 \t\nEurope and other\t292 \t\t\t56 \t\t\t422 \t\t\t244 \t\t\t78 \t\t\t1,092 \t\nTotal revenue\t$\t1,679 \t\t\t$\t1,823 \t\t\t$\t2,068 \t\t\t$\t497 \t\t\t$\t564 \t\t\t$\t6,631 \t\nYear ended December 31, 2022\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nNorth America\t$\t2,659 \t\t\t$\t2,722 \t\t\t$\t2,930 \t\t\t$\t294 \t\t\t$\t605 \t\t\t$\t9,210 \t\nEurope and other\t431 \t\t\t170 \t\t\t642 \t\t\t551 \t\t\t182 \t\t\t1,976 \t\nTotal revenue\t$\t3,090 \t\t\t$\t2,892 \t\t\t$\t3,572 \t\t\t$\t845 \t\t\t$\t787 \t\t\t$\t11,186 \t\nYear ended December 31, 2021\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nNorth America\t$\t1,575 \t\t\t$\t1,880 \t\t\t$\t1,667 \t\t\t$\t212 \t\t\t$\t400 \t\t\t$\t5,734 \t\nEurope and other\t212 \t\t\t— \t\t\t121 \t\t\t298 \t\t\t173 \t\t\t804 \t\nTotal revenue\t$\t1,787 \t\t\t$\t1,880 \t\t\t$\t1,788 \t\t\t$\t510 \t\t\t$\t573 \t\t\t$\t6,538 \t\n \nAccounts Receivable and Customer Advances\nOur customers purchase our products through sales on credit or forward sales. Products sold to our customers on credit are recorded as accounts receivable when the customer obtains control of the product. Customers that purchase our products on credit are required to pay in accordance with our customary payment terms, which are generally less than 30 days. For 2023, 2022 and 2021, the amount of customer bad debt expense recognized was not material.\nFor forward sales, the customer prepays a portion of the value of the sales contract prior to obtaining control of the product. These prepayments, when received, are recorded as customer advances and are recognized as revenue when the customer obtains control of the product. Forward sales are customarily offered for periods of less than one year in advance of when the customer obtains control of the product. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, we had $130 million and $229 million, respectively, in customer advances on our consolidated balance sheets. The decrease in the balance of customer advances was due primarily to lower average selling prices in 2023 compared to 2022. During 2023, all of our customer advances that were recorded as of December 31, 2022 were recognized as revenue.\nWe have certain customer contracts with performance obligations where if the customer does not take the required amount of product specified in the contract, then the customer is required to make a payment to us, the amount of which payment may vary based upon the terms and conditions of the applicable contract. As of December 31, 2023, excluding contracts with original durations of less than one year, and based on the minimum product tonnage to be sold and current market price estimates, our remaining performance obligations under these contracts were approximately $2.5 billion. We expect to recognize approximately 28% of these performance obligations as revenue in 2024, approximately 17% as revenue during 2025-2027, approximately 14% as revenue during 2028-2030, and the remainder as revenue thereafter. Subject to the terms and conditions of the applicable contracts, if these customers do not satisfy their purchase obligations under such contracts, the minimum amount that they would be required to pay to us under such contracts, in the aggregate, was approximately $1.3 billion as of December 31, 2023. Other than the performance obligations described above, any performance obligations with our customers that were unfulfilled or partially filled at December 31, 2023 will be satisfied in 2024.\nAll of our contracts require that the period between the payment for goods and the transfer of those goods to the customer occur within normal contractual terms that do not exceed one year; therefore, we have elected the practical expedient and not adjusted the transaction price of any of our contracts to recognize a significant financing component. We have also elected the practical expedient to not capitalize any incremental costs associated with obtaining a contract that has a duration of less than one year, and there were no costs capitalized during 2023, 2022 or 2021."

      "ground_truth": "The provided data clearly explains the company’s approach to identifying and allocating performance obligations under contracts that involve multiple shipments or continuous supply arrangements. Specifically:\n\n1. **Identification of Performance Obligations**: For contracts involving multiple shipments, each shipment is treated as a distinct performance obligation. This is evidenced by the explanation that “our performance obligations under a customer contract correspond to each shipment of product that we make to our customer.” For continuous supply contracts, where the company supplies products on an ongoing basis, revenue is recognized based on the quantity of products transferred during the period, meaning the obligation is satisfied as and when products are delivered.\n\n2. **Allocation of Transaction Price**: The company allocates the entire transaction price to the sale of the product, which is then distributed among the multiple performance obligations on the basis of their relative standalone selling prices. In contracts with multiple shipments, this allocation reflects the price agreed for each shipment, while in continuous supply obligations, it reflects the quantities delivered over time.\n\n3. **Impact on Revenue Consistency and Predictability**: By identifying each shipment as a separate performance obligation and recognizing revenue as these obligations are satisfied, the company aligns revenue recognition with the timing of delivery. In continuous supply contracts, revenue is recognized proportionately to the quantity delivered per period. This detailed and systematic approach provides consistency as revenue is recorded exactly when control is transferred to the customer—whether through individual shipments or continuous deliveries. As a result, it enhances predictability because the revenue streams from long-term contracts can be forecasted based on known contractual performance obligations and scheduled delivery volumes.\n\nThis method not only ensures that revenue recognition is in compliance with accounting standards (by recognizing revenue at the point in time or over time as control transfers) but also contributes to stable revenue reporting. Investors and analysts can rely on the fact that revenue is not erratically recognized, and that even in complex contractual arrangements, there should be a consistent matching of performance and revenue over the contract term."

Because these commitments are staggered with only smaller amounts due in the near term compared to the total balances, the company is likely to experience moderate near‐term cash outflows rather than large, one‐time liquidity drains. For example, for operating leases, only $83,059 (thousands) is due in less than 1 year; similarly, inventory-related commitments show $153,434 (thousands) due within the next year. This phased distribution helps in easing the liquidity pressure by spreading cash outlays over multiple periods. However, while near-term cash flow requirements are manageable, the significant future commitments mean that the company must plan for longer‐term cash flow management, possibly requiring refinancing or strategic cash management. In summary, the staggered nature improves near-term liquidity but necessitates a careful overall cash flow planning to address the larger obligations in subsequent periods."

In terms of monitoring, the text suggests that Huntington tracks these competitive rate changes alongside other factors such as overall market conditions, regulatory changes, and the financial health of peer institutions. Although the reference does not detail specific metrics or calculation methods, it can be inferred that the bank uses a combination of market analysis, customer behavior studies, and internal liquidity metrics to monitor and respond to these competitive interest rate variations."

First, the signatures and dates indicate a formal and recent endorsement of the current leadership team and board composition, reflecting a stable and robust governance structure. This strong leadership alignment supports continuity, enhances oversight, and could improve stakeholder confidence.\n\nSecondly, having a full slate of executive and board signatures from August 26, 2024, implies that strategic priorities will be guided by individuals with distinct roles and specializations. For example, the presence of both the CFO and the Chief Accounting Officer on the signed list highlights a commitment to financial discipline and risk management. Meanwhile, the broad and diverse board composition — including individuals serving in directorial or independent capacities — ensures a mix of perspectives. This diversity of expertise can drive balanced and forward-looking decision making, potentially positioning the company to pursue innovative strategic initiatives or navigate competitive shifts effectively.\n\nIn summary, these appointments are a signal of solidified governance practices, continuity in leadership, and a well-equipped board that can support and drive future strategic initiatives, aligning the company’s goals with market challenges and opportunities."

        "The Company recognizes revenue when performance obligations identified under the terms of contracts with its customers are satisfied, which generally occurs, for products, upon the transfer of control in accordance with the contractual terms and conditions of the sale. The majority of the Company’s revenue associated with products is recognized at a point in time when the product is shipped to the customer, with a relatively small amount of transactions in the Utility Solutions segment recognized upon delivery of the product at the contractually specified destination.\nThe Company also has performance obligations, primarily within the Utility Solutions segment, that are recognized over time due to the customized nature of the product and the Company's enforceable right to receive payment for work performed to date in the event of a cancellation. The Company uses an input measure to determine the extent of progress towards completion of the performance obligation, which the Company believes best depicts the transfer of control to the customer. Under this method, revenue recognition is based upon the ratio of costs incurred to date compared with estimated total costs to complete.\nRevenue from service contracts and post-shipment performance obligations is approximately two percent of total annual consolidated net revenue and those service contracts and post-shipment obligations are primarily within the Utility Solutions segment. Revenue from service contracts and post-shipment performance obligations is recognized when or as those obligations are satisfied. The Company primarily offers assurance-type standard warranties that do not represent separate performance obligations and on occasion will separately offer and price extended warranties that are separate performance obligations for which the associated revenue is recognized over-time based on the extended warranty period. The Company records amounts billed to customers for reimbursement of shipping and handling costs within revenue. Shipping and handling costs associated with outbound freight after control over a product has transferred to a customer are accounted for as fulfillment costs and are included in cost of goods sold. Sales taxes and other usage-based taxes are excluded from revenue.\nWithin the Electrical Solutions segment, certain businesses require a portion of the transaction price to be paid in advance of transfer of control. Advance payments are not considered a significant financing component as they are received less than one year before the related performance obligations are satisfied. In addition, in the Utility Solutions segment, certain businesses offer annual maintenance service contracts that require payment at the beginning of the contract period. These payments are treated as a contract liability and are classified in Other accrued liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Once control transfers to the customer and the Company meets the revenue recognition criteria, the deferred revenue is recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Income. The deferred revenue relating to the annual maintenance service contracts is recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Income on a straight line basis over the expected term of the contract.\nThe Company has certain arrangements that require us to estimate at the time of sale the amounts of variable consideration that should not be recorded as revenue as certain amounts are not expected to be collected from customers, as well as an estimate of the value of the product to be returned. The Company principally relies on historical experience, specific customer agreements and anticipated future trends to estimate these amounts at the time of shipment and to reduce the transaction price. These arrangements include sales discounts and allowances based on sales volumes, specific programs and special pricing allowances, and returned goods, as are customary in the electrical products industry. Customer returns have historically been approximately one percent of gross sales."

      "ground_truth": "The reference indicates that, for customized projects in the Utility Solutions segment, revenue is recognized using an input measure—specifically, by comparing the costs incurred to date against the total estimated costs to complete the project. This approach influences the estimation of progress and ultimately affects margins and operating profitability in several ways:\n\n1. Revenue Timing and Recognition: As revenue is recognized in proportion to the costs incurred, any misestimation of the total costs directly impacts the timing and amount of revenue recognized. If total costs are underestimated, revenue may be recognized more quickly than warranted, while overestimating costs could delay revenue recognition.\n\n2. Impact on Margins: Margins are influenced by the relationship between recognized revenue and the associated costs. Since revenue is recognized as costs are incurred, any errors in cost estimation can lead to reported margins that do not accurately reflect true project profitability. For example, if actual costs exceed estimates, recognized revenue might lag behind incurred expenses, thereby compressing margins in the reporting period.\n\n3. Operating Profitability Volatility: The method ties revenue recognition closely to cost performance. If a project experiences cost overruns or delays, the progress toward project completion is reassessed, which can result in fluctuations in recognized revenue. These fluctuations can manifest as volatility in operating profitability over time, making it challenging to predict future performance with accuracy.\n\n4. Sensitivity to Cost Estimates: Since the method relies on estimated total costs to complete a project, any changes in cost projections (due to unforeseen challenges or changes in project scope) will directly affect the ratio used to recognize revenue. Such sensitivity means that prudent cost estimation and continuous monitoring are crucial to maintain accurate and stable margin reporting and overall profitability analysis.\n\nIn summary, the input measure-based revenue recognition method ensures that revenue and profits are recorded in line with the actual progress of work, but it also makes reported margins and operating profitability highly dependent on the accuracy of cost estimates and the management of any variances between estimated and actual costs."

        "irius\nOn December 1, 2021, the Company completed its acquisition of all issued and outstanding equity interests of Sirius for an aggregate consideration paid, net of cash acquired, of approximately $2.4 billion. Transaction costs related to the acquisition were $35 million, which are included in Selling and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2021. The Company used the net proceeds from the December 1, 2021 issuance of the $2.5 billion aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes to finance the acquisition and related transaction costs. For additional information on the issuance of the senior notes, see Note 9 (Debt).\nSirius is a leading provider of secure, mission-critical technology-based solutions and is one of the largest IT solutions integrators in the United States, leveraging its services-led approach, broad portfolio of hybrid infrastructure solutions, and deep technical expertise of its 2,600 coworkers to support corporate and public customers. This strategic acquisition enhances the Company’s breadth and depth of services and solutions offerings.\nFollowing the close of the acquisition, the Company issued a mix of cash and equity-based retention awards to certain Sirius coworkers, which vest over a required service period and will be recorded as expense over the required service period. The results of operations of Sirius are included in the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company beginning on the acquisition date. These amounts are presented within the Corporate, Small Business and Public reportable segments. For the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements included $197 million of net sales and $9 million of net income from the results of operations of Sirius.\nThe Sirius acquisition has been accounted for as a business combination. During the fourth quarter of 2022, the Company finalized the purchase price and completed its identification and measurement of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the date of the acquisition. There were no significant adjustments to the preliminary purchase price allocation disclosed in the December 31, 2021 Consolidated Financial Statements. The table below summarizes the final purchase price allocation to acquired assets, including goodwill and intangible assets.\nAcquisition-Date\nFair Value\nCash and cash equivalents\t\t$\t52.8 \t\nAccounts receivable\t\t634.1 \t\nIntangible assets, net\t\t1,164.0 \t\nGoodwill\t\t1,566.6 \t\nOther assets\t\t438.1 \t\nTotal assets acquired\t\t3,855.6 \t\nAccounts payable-trade\t\t633.8 \t\nDebt\t\t170.1 \t\nDeferred tax liabilities\t\t207.0 \t\nOther liabilities\t\t389.7 \t\nTotal liabilities assumed\t\t1,400.6 \t\nTotal purchase price\t\t$\t2,455.0 \t\n \nThe Company used the income approach to value the intangible assets, consisting of acquired customer relationships and trade name. The fair value measurements were primarily based on significant inputs that are not observable, which are categorized as a Level 3 measurement in the fair value hierarchy. Significant inputs used to value these intangible assets include projection of all future cash flows, long-term growth rates, customer attrition rates, discount rates, \nroyalty rates and applicable income tax rates. The excess purchase price recorded to goodwill primarily represents the future economic benefits the Company expects to achieve as a result of combining operations and Sirius’ workforce. The Company finalized its allocation of goodwill to the reportable segments during the fourth quarter of 2022. For additional information on goodwill allocation, see Note 6 (Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets).\nThe amount of goodwill expected to be deductible for income tax purposes is estimated to be $160 million.\nThe table below summarizes the fair value of identifiable intangible assets acquired.\nUseful Lives (Years)\t\tAcquisition-Date\nFair Value\nCustomer relationships\t\t12\t\t$\t1,140.0 \t\nTrade name\t\t1\t\t24.0 \t\n$\t1,164.0 \t\n \nThe following unaudited pro forma financial information presents the combined results of operations as if the acquisition of Sirius had been consummated on January 1, 2020. The pro forma adjustments are based on historical results of operations and financial condition of the Company and Sirius and do not include any anticipated synergies or other expected benefits of the acquisition. The unaudited pro forma financial information is not necessarily indicative of the actual consolidated results of operations had the acquisition actually consummated on January 1, 2020, nor are they indicative of future consolidated results of operations of the combined company.\nYear Ended December 31,\n2021\t\t2020\nPro forma net sales\t\t$\t22,793.0 \t\t\t$\t20,659.0 \t\nPro forma net income\t\t977.4 \t\t\t771.1 \t\n \nThe pro forma adjustments include, among other things:\n•Estimated impact to conform Sirius’ classification to the Company’s financial statement presentation.\n•Estimated amortization expense of intangible assets acquired.\n•Estimated compensation expense for the cash and equity retention awards.\n•Interest expense for the additional indebtedness incurred to fund the acquisition.\n•Transaction costs that have been incurred in connection with the acquisition.\nFocal Point Data Risk LLC and certain affiliates (“Focal Point”)\nOn July 30, 2021, the Company completed the acquisition of Focal Point through a purchase of all issued and outstanding equity interests. Focal Point is a leading US-based cybersecurity services firm that brings a team skilled in identity and access management as well as the ability to serve customers across the full cybersecurity landscape. This strategic acquisition expands the Company’s services and capabilities to help customers address risks posed by malicious cyber threats and cyber workforce shortages, while helping customers navigate shifting data protection laws. The acquisition of Focal Point was not material to the Company’s results of operations and financial condition.

These amounts are presented within the Public reportable segment and are insignificant during the year ended December 31, 2021. The purchase price allocation was final during the second quarter of 2022 and there were no adjustments to the preliminary purchase price allocation.

      "ground_truth": "For the Sirius acquisition, the final purchase price allocation provides clear figures for both intangible assets and goodwill. The total purchase price was approximately $2,455 million. Out of the allocated amounts:\n\n1. Intangible Assets (net): $1,164 million\n   • Customer Relationships: $1,140 million (with an assigned useful life of 12 years)\n   • Trade Name: $24 million (with a useful life of 1 year)\n\n   This means that, assuming straight‐line amortization, the customer relationships will incur annual amortization expense of roughly $95 million ($1,140 million divided by 12 years), while the trade name will be amortized entirely within one year at about $24 million. These periodic amortization charges will reduce future reported earnings over the respective useful lives of these assets.\n\n2. Goodwill: $1,566.6 million\n   • Unlike the identified intangible assets, goodwill is not amortized. Instead, it is subject to an annual impairment test. Therefore, there will be no regular expense recognized from goodwill unless an impairment is identified. An adverse impairment charge, if needed in the future, could negatively affect earnings.\n\nIn summary, starting from the acquisition date, future earnings will be impacted by the recurring amortization of the identifiable intangible assets (approximately $95 million per year for customer relationships and a one-time $24 million impact for the trade name in the first year post-acquisition). Meanwhile, goodwill will not affect earnings periodically but could impact the income statement if an impairment loss is recorded in subsequent periods."

Market Reputation and Stakeholder Confidence – Directors with high public profiles can positively influence investor sentiment and enhance corporate image. Their reputations can also attract strategic alliances and partnerships.\n\n4. Risk Management and Innovation – Diverse board members can better identify risks and opportunities because they bring different viewpoints, which may foster innovation and agile responses to market changes.\n\n5. Cultural and Global Insights – Considering the geographic and cultural diversity, which can be significant for a global company like Expedia Group, Inc. International experience may support the company’s growth in various regional markets.\n\nIn summary, investors will look for how well these directors’ diverse experiences and expertise align with and support the company’s long-term strategic initiatives, risk oversight, and growth ambitions."

        "Passenger revenue is recognized when transportation is provided. Passenger tickets and related ancillary services sold by the Company for flights are purchased primarily via credit card transactions, with payments collected by the Company in advance of the performance of related services. The Company initially records ticket sales in its Advance ticket sales liability, deferring revenue recognition until the travel occurs. For travel that has more than one flight segment, the Company deems each segment as a separate performance obligation and recognizes revenue for each segment as travel occurs. Tickets sold by other airlines where the Company provides the transportation are recognized as passenger revenue at the estimated value to be billed to the other airline when travel is provided. Differences between amounts billed and the actual amounts may be rejected and rebilled or written off if the amount recorded was different from the original estimate. When necessary, the Company records a reserve against its billings and payables with other airlines based on historical experience.\nThe Company sells certain tickets with connecting flights with one or more segments operated by its other airline partners. For segments operated by its other airline partners, the Company has determined that it is acting as an agent on behalf of the other airlines as they are responsible for their portion of the contract (i.e. transportation of the passenger). The Company, as the agent, recognizes revenue within Other operating revenue at the time of the travel for the net amount representing commission to be retained by the Company for any segments flown by other airlines.\nAdvance ticket sales represent the Company's liability to provide air transportation in the future. All tickets sold at any given point in time have travel dates through the next 12 months. The Company defers amounts related to future travel in its Advance ticket sales liability account.\nThe Company estimates the value of Advance ticket sales that will expire unused (\"breakage\") and recognizes revenue and any changes in estimates in proportion to the usage of the related tickets. To determine breakage, the Company uses its historical experience with expired tickets and certificates and other facts, such as recent aging trends, program changes and modifications that could affect the ultimate expiration patterns."

In practice, this treatment results in passenger revenue being recognized in alignment with the actual travel provided. For tickets involving segments operated by partner airlines, United acts as an agent and recognizes only the net commission related to these segments.

      "ground_truth": "The data provided allows us to assess the impact of financing activities on liquidity and overall cash reserves over recent years. Key observations include:\n\n1. Significant cash outflows from financing activities: In all three years, the company recorded large negative net financing cash flows – about -$14.9 billion in 2022 and 2024, and -$12.1 billion in 2023. These outflows are driven primarily by high dividend payments (around $8.8–$9.3 billion annually) and substantial treasury stock purchases (ranging from $5.0 billion in 2024 to $10.0 billion in 2022).\n\n2. Net debt adjustments: The financing section also shows both increases and reductions in short-term and long-term debt. For example, in 2024, there were additions and reductions in short-term and long-term debt that, on net, contributed to the overall cash outflow. While new debt increased liquidity temporarily, the larger repayments (such as the comparatively higher reductions in short-term debt) along with regular debt servicing have reduced the cash available.\n\n3. Impact on liquidity and cash position: Despite these significant financing outflows, the company’s ending cash balances have grown over the period—from $7.214 billion in 2022 to $8.246 billion in 2023, and then to $9.482 billion in 2024. This indicates that robust operating cash inflows (with operating activities netting approximately $16.7–$19.8 billion annually) provided sufficient liquidity to not only cover these financing outflows but also to increase the overall cash reserves.\n\n4. Strategic capital allocation: The pattern of financing activities reflects a deliberate capital allocation strategy focused on returning capital to shareholders (via dividends and buybacks), even at the expense of reducing cash reserves. The company appears to balance this shareholder return strategy with maintaining healthy liquidity, as evidenced by the continued growth in cash from operating activities.\n\nIn summary, the aggressive financing actions – including high dividend payouts, significant treasury stock repurchases, and the net adjustments in debt – have resulted in large annual cash outflows in financing. However, strong operating cash flows have offset these outflows, allowing the company’s overall cash position to grow, albeit at a moderated rate. This reflects a balanced approach where the company leverages debt issuance (and subsequent repayments) as a temporary liquidity tool while prioritizing shareholder returns."

        "Cybersecurity Risk Management and Strategy\n\nParker is committed to the protection of the Company’s data, data systems and digital assets while in storage, use or transit. Our cybersecurity program is integrated into our overall Enterprise Risk Management program and exists to secure our information systems and data assets, including those data assets entrusted to us by our stakeholders, and to promote our compliance with applicable laws and regulations.\nWe proactively work to address cybersecurity risk through our Digital & IT Risk Management Program, which focuses on identifying, assessing, responding to, monitoring and remediating cybersecurity-related risks. Parker’s dedicated Cyber Security team utilizes the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cyber Security Framework as its primary resource for identifying areas of risk and benchmarking and implementing continuous improvements. Our technical security configuration employs a centrally managed, layered approach, including hardened PCs, endpoint security detection software, email security, firewall appliances, and various network security protections. We employ enhanced security measures for operational technologies and secure account management, including recently adding a secondary anti-malware solution to our existing software to bolster our company-wide defenses. Additionally, we utilize third-party security monitoring services to further improve our 24/7 monitoring capabilities. We also maintain a third-party risk management program designed to oversee, identify, and reduce the potential impact to Parker and our customers of a security incident at a third-party vendor, supplier or other provider.\n\nWe have adopted comprehensive Information Security Policies and Standards that clearly articulate Parker’s expectations and requirements with respect to acceptable use, risk management, data privacy, education and awareness, security incident management and reporting, identity and access management, third-party management, security (with respect to physical assets, products, networks and systems), security monitoring and vulnerability identification. These policies and standards set forth a detailed security incident management and reporting protocol, with clear escalation timelines and responsibilities. We also maintain a global incident response plan and regularly conduct exercises to help with our overall preparedness.\n\nWe believe cybersecurity is the responsibility of every team member and provide ongoing mandatory cybersecurity awareness training globally to help team members recognize, avoid and report malicious activity. This includes interactive training to engage team members in identifying phishing risks and their appropriate response. We also provide regular training on data protection so that our team members understand the types of data they have and how to safeguard it.\n\nContinuous improvement is a critical aspect of Parker’s cybersecurity program, which is why we integrate security intelligence from internal and external sources to help identify areas for improvement and gap remediation. As a supplement to our internal cybersecurity capabilities and controls, we partner with third-party consultants and advisors to conduct penetration testing and to assess our incident response plan. We periodically undergo a third-party risk assessment and third-party incident response adversarial engagement exercises to strengthen our security profile. We also conduct internal tabletop exercises to prepare for responding to potential cybersecurity events. Parker also maintains cyber security insurance designed to mitigate the impact of any attacks or threats to our business.\n\nAs of the date of this report, we do not believe that any risks from cybersecurity threats, including as a result of any previous cybersecurity incidents, have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the Company, including its business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition. However, as discussed more fully under Item 1A. “Risk Factors—Business and Operational Risks” of this Form 10-K, cybersecurity threats remain a risk to our business operations.\n\nCybersecurity Governance\n\nManagement is responsible for assessing and managing material risks from cybersecurity threats with leadership from the Company’s Vice President – Chief Digital and Information Officer (CDIO), who is responsible for the Company’s global Digital, Information Technology and Cyber Security organization. Our CDIO has served in various roles in information technology and information security for over 18 years with Fortune 500 companies. Our CDIO holds Bachelor of Science and Master of Science degrees in Computer Engineering. He has also completed other advanced leadership training and coursework regarding cybersecurity risk management. Our CDIO reports directly to the Chief Executive Officer.\n\nParker’s cybersecurity program is led by our Digital & IT VP – Infrastructure and Security, who functions as our chief information security officer (CISO) and has over 23 years of experience in cybersecurity operations, cybersecurity governance and compliance, risk management, operational technology (OT) and connected products (IoT) with global Fortune 200 and Fortune 500 companies across diverse industries, such as retail, consumer goods, entertainment and manufacturing. The CISO reports to our CDIO and is supported by and receives regular updates from our dedicated Cyber Security team within our IT function, as well as our IT Risk Council, a cross-functional group that meets regularly to optimize our Digital & IT Risk Management Program and promote alignment with our Enterprise Risk Management program.\n\nRecognizing the importance of maintaining a secure environment for our products, data and systems that effectively supports our business objectives and customer needs, Parker’s full Board of Directors maintains oversight of cybersecurity. Our Board receives an in-depth report from our CDIO, at least annually, on the overall cybersecurity program, and updates throughout the year from our CDIO and CISO regarding such topics as cyber-risk management and the status of projects to strengthen cybersecurity effectiveness."

The details indicate that the company has integrated cybersecurity into its overall Enterprise Risk Management program by adopting the NIST Cyber Security Framework, implementing layered security measures, and ensuring robust governance through experienced leadership. These proactive steps mitigate risks that could otherwise disrupt operations or lead to financial losses from breaches, thereby enhancing investor confidence.\n\nFrom an investment perspective, strong cybersecurity controls reduce operational and reputational risk, which is a significant concern for many investors. A proactive and well-governed risk management framework reassures investors that potential threats are identified, assessed, and mitigated before they can materially impact the business. This continuous improvement and comprehensive monitoring support not only the protection of assets but also the sustainable operation and growth of the company.\n\nThus, by enhancing the overall security posture and reducing the likelihood of costly disruptions, Parker-Hannifin’s cybersecurity strategy helps to build trust with stakeholders. This trust, in turn, can contribute to stable revenue streams and support long-term growth, offering a competitive advantage that aligns with sustainable future growth."

On the one hand, several executives are in their late 50s and early 60s with long tenures (for example, the Chairman/CEO at age 61, the CFO at age 59, and others with employment start dates ranging from the 1980s to the early 2000s), which indicates deep institutional knowledge, stability, and continuity in governance. However, this also suggests potential challenges as these individuals approach retirement age, necessitating proactive succession planning to avoid leadership gaps and to ensure smooth transitions. On the other hand, the presence of younger executives (such as the 40-year-old Executive Vice President in Retail Banking) offers a promising opportunity to introduce fresh perspectives and drive innovation within the organization. This diversity in age and experience can provide a balanced mix of stability and dynamism, provided the company implements robust mentoring and talent development programs. Overall, while the long career tenures support strong governance, they also signal an impending need to identify and prepare the next generation of leaders to maintain that strength and mitigate risks associated with experienced executive turnover."

        "While a large number of enterprises and service providers, such as hyperscale cloud service providers, own their own data centers, we believe the industry is shifting away from single-tenant solutions to customers outsourcing some or all of their IT housing and interconnection requirements to third-party facilities, such as those operated by Equinix. This shift is being accelerated by the increasing adoption of hybrid multicloud architectures and the adoption of artificial intelligence.\nHistorically, the outsourcing market was served by large telecommunications carriers that bundled their products and services with their colocation offerings. The data center market landscape has evolved to include private and vendor-neutral MTDC providers, public and private cloud providers, managed infrastructure and application hosting providers, and systems integrators. It is estimated that Equinix is one of more than 2,200 companies that provide MTDC offerings around the world. The global MTDC market is highly fragmented. Each of these data center solutions providers can bundle various colocation, interconnection and network offerings, outsourced IT infrastructure solutions and managed services. We believe that this outsourcing trend has accelerated and is likely to continue to accelerate in the coming years, especially in light of the movement to digital business, the use of multiple cloud service providers, and the adoption of artificial intelligence.\nEquinix is differentiated in this market by being able to offer customers a global platform that reaches over 30 countries and contains the industry’s largest and most active ecosystem of partners in our sites, including access to a leading share of cloud on-ramps, and an increasingly diverse ecosystem of networks and cloud and IT service providers. This ecosystem creates a “network effect,” which improves performance and lowers the cost for our customers, enabling them to become digital leaders, and is a significant source of competitive advantage for Equinix. Additionally, our digital solutions portfolio enables customers to bring together physical and programmable technologies like compute, storage, network and applications to build a foundation for their company's digital operations."

      "reference": [
        "Risk Management and Strategy\nInformation security risks have significantly increased in recent years in part because of the proliferation of new technologies, the increasing use of the Internet and telecommunications technologies to conduct our operations, and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime, hackers, terrorists and other external parties, including, among others, foreign state agents. Our business and operations rely on the secure and continuous processing, transmission and storage of confidential, proprietary and other information in our computer systems and networks, including sensitive personal information, such as PHI, social security numbers, and/or credit card information of our patients, teammates, physicians, business partners and others. Our business and operations also rely on certain critical IT vendors that support such processing, transmission and storage (which have become more relevant and important given the information security issues and risks that are intensified through our increased use of remote work arrangements).\nTo manage risks to our Company, including information and security risks, our Board oversees our enterprise-wide approach to risk management with a fundamental belief that the key components of risk management are:\n•Identifying potential risks that we face;\n•Assessing the likelihood and potential impact of the risks;\n•Adopting strategies and controls designed to manage the risks;\n•Reporting on a regular basis regarding the assessment and management of the risks; and\n•Monitoring these potential risks on a regular basis.\nOur Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) team leads this risk management process, and evaluates risks to the enterprise on short, intermediate and long-term bases. Our ERM team reports to our ERM Committee, a group comprised of members of senior management who meet on a regular basis to oversee the performance of these risk management functions. We assess risks using a probability-magnitude lens, with shorter and intermediate term risks generally given greater weight. We prioritize mitigating activities on shorter and intermediate term risks, but also use risk analyses and oversight to proactively incorporate mitigating activities into our long-term strategy. The ERM process reflects a Company-wide effort designed to identify, assess, manage, report and monitor enterprise risks and risk areas. This effort includes the Company's Enterprise Risk Services (Internal Audit), Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX), Compliance Audit, legal and IT Security teams, among others. The identification and evaluation of cybersecurity threats and risks is integrated into this ERM process.\nThe ERM process is incorporated into our disclosure controls and procedures. Representatives of each of our ERM, Legal, Internal Audit and Compliance Audit teams sit on the Company’s management Disclosure Committee, which is responsible for, among other things, the design and establishment of disclosure controls and procedures to help ensure the timeliness, accuracy and completeness of corporate disclosure. Our IT Security and Privacy teams, who are responsible for assessing cybersecurity threats and risks, in turn maintain policies and procedures designed to ensure appropriate escalation of cybersecurity incidents to meet external disclosure requirements. Our Chief Information Officer (CIO) and Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) regularly meet and coordinate with our Chief Privacy Officer (CPO). Each of the CIO, CISO and CPO also advise members of the Disclosure Committee, including our Chief Legal and Public Affairs Officer (CLO), on disclosure matters on an as-needed basis.\nWith respect to assessing privacy, data and cybersecurity risks, the Company adopts a hybrid approach that primarily aligns with the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework, including the guidance set forth in the NIST HIPAA Security Rule Cybersecurity Guide, while also evaluating against certain elements of the ISO 27001 and 27005 standards that management believes provide additional levels of guidance or structure. We regularly evaluate the Company’s cybersecurity and privacy processes and procedures, both through regular audits by our Internal Audit and IT security teams, as well as regular retention of outside advisors under direction of our IT security team. Among other things, the IT security team oversees an external third party review at least every two years that evaluates the readiness of the entire Company against the NIST Cybersecurity Framework and provides an assessment that measures Capability Maturity Model Integration levels. Additionally, our CISO engages in regular consultations, typically monthly, with third-party cybersecurity advisors. Among other things, these sessions provide the Company with a broader review of the external cybersecurity environment, helping us to stay current on emerging or developing security approaches and risks. Among other initiatives, our CISO and the Company’s IT security team have actively participated in industry conferences and maintain memberships to resources such as the Health Information Sharing and Analysis Center (Health-ISAC), a trusted community of critical infrastructure owners and operators within the Health Care and Public Health sector which, among other things, allows the Company to monitor email updates and alerts coordinated with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency. In order to maintain awareness of privacy, data and cybersecurity risks, the Company incorporates these topics into its annual compliance training materials that are mandatory for all teammates and new hires, and among other things cover HIPAA privacy and security requirements.\nWe maintain policies and have established processes involving our cybersecurity, privacy and legal teams that assess potential cybersecurity risks associated with our retention and use of third-party service providers. These policies and procedures are generally aligned with the NIST Cybersecurity Framework. Prior to retaining or renewing a third-party vendor, the Company policy requires a risk assessment of such potential new vendor or new engagement through a collaborative process among the Company’s IT security, privacy, insurance and legal teams, among others. Potential vendor engagements also are reviewed to assess a range of other considerations and contractual terms and conditions, including, among other things, a potential vendor’s liability insurance limits, scope and coverage of cyber insurance and privacy data protections. Our IT SOX team also conducts annual SOX reviews for those vendors that are considered in scope for SOX controls. All finalized vendor engagements are considered by Internal Audit as part of our ordinary course risk assessment and audit planning.\nCybersecurity Risks and the Impact on our Company\nDue to the continuously evolving series of laws and regulations related to cybersecurity, data protection and privacy that are applicable to our business, as well as the associated risks from cybersecurity threats, we have expended significant resources in order to protect our information systems and data. We regularly review, monitor and implement multiple layers of security measures through technology, processes and our people. We utilize security technologies designed to protect and maintain the integrity of our information systems and data, and our defenses are monitored and routinely tested internally and by external parties. Despite these efforts, our facilities and systems and those of our third-party service providers may be vulnerable to privacy and security incidents; security attacks and breaches; acts of vandalism or theft; computer viruses and other malicious code; coordinated attacks by a variety of actors, including, among others, activist entities or state sponsored cyberattacks; emerging cybersecurity risks; cyber risk related to connected devices; misplaced or lost data; programming and/or human errors; or other similar events that could impact the security, reliability and availability of our systems. Internal or external parties have attempted to, and will continue to attempt to, circumvent our security systems, and we have in the past, and expect that we will in the future, defend against, experience, and respond to attacks on our network including, without limitation, reconnaissance probes, denial of service attempts, malicious software attacks including ransomware or other attacks intended to render our internal operating systems or data unavailable, and phishing attacks or business email compromise. While we have experienced cybersecurity incidents in the past, to date none have had a material impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nCybersecurity requires ongoing investment and diligence against evolving threats and in the context of new or developing technologies. For further information regarding the risks we face from cybersecurity threats and how our business strategy, results of operations, and financial condition could be materially affected by such risks, see Item I.A. Risk Factors under the heading, “Privacy and information security laws are complex…”.\nGovernance\nBoard Oversight\nAs part of their oversight responsibilities, the Audit Committee and the Compliance and Quality Committee monitor privacy, data and cyber security as specific risk areas. Both Mr. Schechter, a member of the Audit Committee and the Compliance and Quality Committee, and Ms. Schoppert, a member of the Audit Committee and the Compliance and Quality Committee, hold a CERT Certificate in Cybersecurity Oversight. The Audit Committee engages in regular discussions with management on privacy, data, and cybersecurity risk exposures, receiving quarterly reports from the ERM team and the CIO. The CPO and/or CLO periodically reports to the Audit Committee about the Company’s privacy program, and Internal Audit reports to the Audit Committee quarterly, providing the Audit Committee with results from any privacy, data, or cybersecurity audits.\nAmong other things, the Company’s privacy team actively develops and implements policies designed to comply with the requirements of privacy laws in the countries where the Company operates. Working with Internal Audit and the CIO, the privacy team assesses the nature and potential severity of privacy risks within DaVita and guides the organization in taking steps to help mitigate such risks. The CPO or CLO provides periodic updates to the Audit Committee on the status of the privacy program. The Audit Committee also oversees the Company's negotiation of any cybersecurity insurance. Currently, the Company maintains a cybersecurity risk insurance policy providing coverage for certain cybersecurity breaches among other specified risks.\nManagement\nAs referenced above, our IT Security team, in consultation with our Privacy Office, is primarily responsible for frontline assessments and management of day-to-day risks from cybersecurity threats, including the monitoring and detection of cybersecurity incidents and the execution of DaVita’s cybersecurity and privacy incident response plans, as needed. Pursuant to the plan, the teams are responsible for assessing and classifying cybersecurity incidents and coordinating the response to such incidents, including managing both internal and external reporting obligations and remediation efforts. Our key personnel responsible for privacy and cybersecurity expertise include our CIO, CISO and CPO. Their qualifications include expertise in international privacy laws, compliance, global IT strategy, and security responsibilities, helping to ensure a comprehensive approach to risk management. Our CISO holds a Certified Chief Information Security Officer certification from EC-Council and a Certified Information Security Manager certification from ISACA. Our CPO is a Certified Information Privacy Professional and a Certified Compliance and Ethics Professional, and has more than two decades of experience in creating and implementing privacy and data protection programs that enable multinational organizations to respect and protect personal data and execute mission critical business strategies.\nOur IT Security team also operates a 24x7 security operations center through a managed service provider. This dedicated center, alongside active monitoring of the dark web for DaVita-related data, and our use of both internal and external tools, is designed to ensure proactive detection, prevention and remediation of cybersecurity incidents. We inform and develop this integrated approach through our ongoing internal and external evaluations and risk assessments of our IT security program as described above."

      "ground_truth": "The provided information clearly explains that DaVita’s governance structure—including active board oversight and the involvement of committees such as the Audit Committee—plays a significant role in mitigating cybersecurity risks that could otherwise harm profitability and affect credit ratings. Specifically, this structure contributes to risk mitigation in the following ways:\n\n1. Proactive Risk Identification and Assessment: The board and its committees, through regular meetings and oversight of the Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) process, ensure that potential cybersecurity threats are identified, assessed, and prioritized based on probability and impact. This early detection allows for timely interventions that prevent substantial losses or disruptions.\n\n2. Coordinated Cross-Functional Management: The involvement of multiple stakeholders (e.g., IT Security, Legal, Compliance Audit, and Privacy teams) in monitoring cybersecurity risks ensures that comprehensive risk assessments occur. This collaborative approach enhances the integration of diverse expertise into the risk management process, thereby strengthening the company’s defenses against cyber incidents.\n\n3. Robust Internal Controls and Reporting: The regular reporting mechanisms—such as quarterly reports from the ERM team and prompts from technical leads like the CIO, CISO, and CPO—facilitate effective monitoring and rapid response. These controls help contain risks before they escalate into operational disruptions or significant financial losses.\n\n4. Enhanced Investor and Creditor Confidence: Active oversight by the board and specialized committees reassures investors and credit rating agencies that the company has a robust framework to manage cybersecurity risks. This, in turn, helps maintain stable profitability by avoiding large-scale incidents and reduces the probability of adverse events that could trigger downgrades in credit ratings.\n\n5. Efficient Capital Allocation: By mitigating cybersecurity risks through strong governance, the company is less likely to incur unforeseen remediation costs, litigation expenses, or loss of business due to security incidents. This efficiency in risk management supports better capital allocation, reinforcing the company's financial stability and creditworthiness.\n\nOverall, this governance structure not only minimizes the potential negative financial impacts from cybersecurity incidents but also reinforces operational resilience that is critical for maintaining profitability and favorable credit ratings."

        "We have three reportable operating segments: 1) North America, which is inclusive of the U.S. and Canada; 2) International, which is inclusive of China, Japan, Asia Pacific, Europe, Middle East, Africa, Latin America, and the Caribbean; and 3) Channel Development. Unallocated corporate expenses are reported within Corporate and Other.\nWe believe our financial results and long-term growth model will continue to be driven by new store openings, comparable store sales, and operating margin management, underpinned by disciplined capital allocation. We believe these key operating metrics are useful to investors because management uses these metrics to assess the growth of our business and the effectiveness of our marketing and operational strategies. Throughout this MD&A, we commonly discuss the following key operating metrics:\n•New store openings and store count\n•Comparable store sales\n•Operating margin\nStarbucks results for fiscal 2024 reflect a challenging operating environment, notably driven by reduced customer traffic compared to fiscal 2023, that pressured our financial results. Consolidated net revenues increased 1% to $36.2 billion in fiscal 2024 compared to $36.0 billion in fiscal 2023, primarily driven by incremental revenues from net new company-operated stores over the past 12 months, partially offset by a decrease in comparable store sales and the impact of unfavorable foreign currency translation.\nFor both the North America segment and U.S. market, revenue increased 2% in fiscal 2024 compared to fiscal 2023, primarily driven by net new company-operated store growth over the past 12 months and higher product and equipment sales to, and royalty revenues from, our licensees. This growth was partially offset by a 2% decline in comparable store sales. Comparable transactions for both the North America segment and the U.S. market declined 5%, partially offset by average ticket growth for both the North America segment and the U.S. market of 4%, primarily driven by annualization of pricing.\nFor the International segment, revenue declined 2% in fiscal 2024 compared to fiscal 2023, primarily driven by the impact of unfavorable foreign currency translation, a 4% decline in comparable store sales driven by a decline in average ticket of 4%, and lower product and equipment sales to, and royalty revenues from, our licensees. These decreases were partially offset by net new company-operated and licensed store openings over the past 12 months.\nRevenue for our Channel Development segment decreased 7% in fiscal 2024 compared with fiscal 2023, primarily driven by a decline in revenue in the Global Coffee Alliance following the sale of our Seattle’s Best Coffee brand to Nestlé in the second quarter of fiscal 2023 as well as product SKU optimization.\nOur performance was lower-than-expected as a result of a pronounced customer traffic decline, reflecting our targeted and accelerated investments not improving customer behaviors as intended, as well as the macroeconomic and competitive environment in China that further pressured our results. Given these challenges, under the direction of our new chief executive officer, Brian Niccol, we are changing our business strategy to bring customers back to our stores and return to growth. Our “Back to Starbucks” strategy includes supporting our green apron partners, enhancing the customer experience, reestablishing ourselves as the community coffee house, and innovating the coffee tasting experience through product development, marketing, and in-store experience. This strategic reset will provide us with the opportunity to assess the business and refocus"

      "ground_truth": "Based on the provided data, it is clear that despite the decline in comparable store sales and diminished customer traffic, Starbucks is leveraging operational strategies and focused operating margin management to partly offset these pressures on profitability. The company’s overall revenue grew modestly from $36.0 billion to $36.2 billion primarily due to incremental revenue from new company‐operated store openings, even though the core same-store sales were down (e.g., a 2% decline in the North America segment and a 4% decline in International comparable store sales). In addition, higher average ticket growth (notably 4% in North America) has contributed to partially mitigating the negative impact of lower traffic. \n\nStarbucks emphasizes disciplined capital allocation and margin management as central elements of its long‐term strategy. This approach focuses on optimizing operational efficiency and cost controls, which helps preserve operating margins even when core metrics like comparable sales are under pressure. Moreover, in response to weaker customer traffic, the company has initiated a strategic reset—its “Back to Starbucks” initiative—to reinvigorate customer engagement through improvements in the in-store experience, enhanced product offerings, and renewed focus on community building. \n\nIn summary, while the decline in comparable store metrics has pressured underlying profitability, strategic investments in new store openings, pricing strategies, and operational efficiency have helped stabilize overall revenue. However, the full benefits of the margin management and operational strategies are expected to materialize as the new strategic initiatives drive improved customer traffic and comparable store performance in the future."

      "ground_truth": "The provided data gives clear schedules for both the purchase obligations and the transition tax payments, so we can assess potential liquidity and cash flow risks for the upcoming fiscal years. Key points include:\n\n1. Concentrated Outflows in 2025: In fiscal 2025, the company is scheduled to pay approximately $816.8 million in purchase obligations and an additional $183.7 million for transition tax—totaling nearly $1.0 billion. This sizable outflow in a single year could strain liquidity if operating cash flows do not sufficiently cover these payments.\n\n2. Subsequent Years’ Commitments: While the amounts in later years (2026 and beyond) are smaller, they still represent contractual cash outlays. For example, fiscal 2026 will see around $29.8 million in purchase obligations combined with $229.6 million for transition tax. The recurring nature of these commitments means that investors must factor these predictable cash drains into liquidity planning over the medium term.\n\n3. Impact on Free Cash Flow: The bulk of the cash flows will be directed towards servicing these commitments. If operating cash flows or free cash flow generation falls short, it could pressure other strategic investments, dividend payments, or even lead to increased borrowing to meet the obligations.\n\n4. Transition Tax Uncertainties: Although the transition tax schedule is defined, the company has the option to apply existing tax credits, which introduces some uncertainty regarding the actual cash outlay. However, any delay or reduction in the application of tax credits might lead to higher than expected cash payments.\n\n5. Overall Liquidity Risk: The combination of a large upfront cash drain in fiscal 2025 and ongoing obligations in subsequent years means that investors should monitor the company’s ability to generate and preserve cash. A significant mismatch between cash inflows (e.g., from operations) and these contractual outflows could necessitate other measures (like reducing capital expenditures or increased financing) that might affect overall financial flexibility.\n\nIn summary, the potential liquidity risk lies in meeting these substantial, scheduled cash outflows amid uncertainties in operating cash flow generation. Investors should thus watch key liquidity metrics and free cash flow trends, especially going into fiscal 2025, to ensure that the company can manage these obligations without sacrificing strategic flexibility or incurring additional financing risk."

        "Cybersecurity Risk Management and Strategy\nWe have developed and implemented a cybersecurity risk management program intended to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our critical systems and information, including our customers’, vendors’, partners’ and employees’ data, including personal information.\nOur cybersecurity risk management program is guided by frameworks and standards promulgated by the EU, National Institute of Standards and Technology, Cloud Security Alliance (“CSA”) and International Organization for Standardization/International Electrotechnical Commission (“ISO/IEC”). While we seek to maintain ISO/IEC 27001:2013, ISO/IEC 27017 and the SOC 2 Type 1 certifications, this does not imply that we specifically or comprehensively comply with technical specification or requirements, only that we use all the above-mentioned standards and regulations as a guide to help us identify, assess and manage cybersecurity risks relevant to our business.\nOur cybersecurity risk management program is integrated into our overall risk oversight strategy and utilizes common reporting channels and governance processes that apply across other risk areas. We have a dedicated Chief Information Security Officer (“CISO”), who leads our Information Security team responsible for managing our cybersecurity processes, strategy and controls. Certain members of our Information Security team hold cybersecurity certifications, including the Certified Information Systems Security Professional (“CISSP”) and the Certified Information Systems Auditor (“CISA”) designations.\nOur cybersecurity risk management program includes:\n•a security incident response plan that includes procedures for responding to cybersecurity incidents;\n•risk assessment processes designed to help identify cybersecurity risks to our critical systems, information, products, services, and our broader enterprise IT environment;\n•our Information Security team, principally responsible for identifying and mitigating cybersecurity risks, and managing our security controls and our response to cybersecurity incidents;\n•the use of external service providers, where appropriate, to assess, test or otherwise assist with certain aspects of our security controls and processes;\n•implementation of new hire and annual data privacy and cybersecurity training of employees, including senior management, and cybersecurity governance training for our Board of Directors;\n•a cybersecurity insurance policy to cover certain types of costs and losses from cybersecurity incidents; and\n•a third-party risk management process, including risk assessment and risk rating, for certain service providers, suppliers, and vendors.\nWe have not identified risks from known cybersecurity threats, including as a result of any prior cybersecurity incidents, that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect us, including our business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition.\nCybersecurity Governance\nOur Board of Directors is responsible for overseeing our enterprise risk management activities in general, and our Board committees assist with certain aspects of risk oversight. With respect to cybersecurity risk, our Board of Directors shares certain of the oversight responsibility and processes with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors (“Audit Committee”).\nThe Audit Committee, comprised entirely of independent directors, reviews and discusses with management our guidelines, policies and practices regarding risk assessment and risk management as they relate to our financial condition, and oversees our financial risk exposures, including planning regarding business continuity and cybersecurity. In addition, the Audit Committee oversees our annual enterprise business risk assessment, which includes the review of cybersecurity risks we face and our associated risk mitigation measures, and receives semi-annual reports from management on cybersecurity matters, including areas such as threat intelligence, major cybersecurity risk areas, regulations and cybersecurity incidents. In addition, management updates the Audit Committee, as necessary, regarding significant cybersecurity incidents, as well as any incidents with lesser impact potential.\nThe Audit Committee reports to the Board of Directors regarding its activities related to cybersecurity. In addition, the Board of Directors also directly receives reports from management on our cybersecurity risk profile and on the performance of our data privacy and cybersecurity risk management program, semi-annually in alternating quarters with the Audit Committee.\nOur management team, including our Chief Information Officer (“CIO”), CISO and the General Counsel, is responsible for assessing and managing material risks from cybersecurity threats, including supervision of our internal security incident response team and our Disclosure Committee comprised of certain of our employees (including any applicable subcommittees thereof). Our management team has relevant expertise in the following:(i) understanding of cybersecurity risks in enterprise operations, (ii) experience in overseeing risk management and understanding risks faced by enterprise operations and (iii) significant operating experience allowing them to provide insight into developing, implementing and assessing our operating plan. In addition, our CISO has over 25 years of broad cybersecurity and information technology risk management experience, is a Certified Information Security Manager (“CISM”) and holds a Master's Degree in computer science and information systems.Our management team supervises efforts to prevent, detect, mitigate, and remediate cybersecurity risks and incidents, and is responsible for oversight and management of our cybersecurity risk management program. Our management team receives briefings from our internal Information Security team and the Disclosure Committee whenever applicable. Such briefings include information regarding threat intelligence and other information obtained from governmental, public or private sources, including external consultants engaged by us, and alerts and reports produced by security tools deployed in our information technology environment. Our management team also provides quarterly cybersecurity risk management program updates, to the Board of Directors or to the Audit Committee, in alternating quarters."

Risk Mitigation and Reduced Uncertainty: Investors view robust cybersecurity measures as a proactive approach to managing risks associated with data breaches, regulatory fines, and business interruptions. By adhering to these standards, the company provides evidence that it has effective controls in place, thereby reducing potential liabilities and uncertainties. This risk reduction can, in turn, lead to a lower cost of capital and, consequently, a higher valuation.\n\n2. Enhanced Credibility and Trust: Certifications from recognized frameworks serve as an independent validation of the company’s cybersecurity practices. For investors, such validations build trust in the company’s internal controls and commitment to maintaining data integrity and secure systems. Enhanced trust helps attract investments as the perceived risk is lower.\n\n3. Competitive Differentiation: In industries where data security is a critical factor, adherence to these standards distinguishes the company from its peers. Investors may be willing to pay a premium for companies that demonstrate strong cybersecurity governance, which is sometimes reflected in higher market multiples.\n\n4. Improved Operational Stability and Continuity: Certified cybersecurity practices generally result in more robust incident response and management protocols. This supports business continuity in the event of an incident, stabilizing cash flows and long-term financial performance—a key metric for investors assessing long-term growth prospects and sustainability.\n\n5. Regulatory and Compliance Advantages: Many regulatory bodies and large enterprise customers require evidence of robust cybersecurity frameworks. Certifications facilitate compliance with regulations and smooth the business acquisition process. Achieving and maintaining these standards can reduce the likelihood of regulatory penalties and streamline business operations, which investors recognize as an added value.\n\nOverall, these certifications improve the company's perceived operational resilience and risk management, which are critical drivers for investor confidence. Higher confidence may lead to increased demand for the stock, potentially boosting valuation over time."

In 2023, AbbVie spent $777 million on capital expenditures—typically aimed at sustaining or modernizing existing operational infrastructure—while also allocating a significantly higher amount ($1.2 billion) toward other acquisitions and investments. This indicates a dual-pronged strategy: internally, the company is committing substantial funds to maintain or enhance its operational base, but it’s also aggressively pursuing external growth through acquisitions. The larger monetary commitment to acquisitions suggests that AbbVie is focused on expanding its market presence and asset base by integrating complementary businesses or technologies, which can enhance its competitive positioning.

      "ground_truth": "The available financial data does allow us to discuss the impact of changes in the composition and fair values within The Travelers’ investment portfolio on its net investment income and overall profitability. First, the balance sheet shows notable changes between 2022 and 2023. Fixed maturities increased in fair value from approximately $71.16 billion to $77.81 billion, suggesting an appreciation in value as well as a larger weighting in the portfolio. Concurrently, short‐term securities rose significantly from $3.47 billion to $5.14 billion, while other investments increased modestly from $4.065 billion to $4.299 billion. Although equity securities declined slightly (from $807 million to $608 million) and other asset classes saw minimal change, the overall investment portfolio grew from $80.45 billion to $88.81 billion.\n\nOn the income side, net investment income increased from $2.56 billion in 2022 to $2.92 billion in 2023. This improvement can be at least partially attributed to the shifts in portfolio composition. A larger allocation to short‐term securities and fixed maturities may provide a more stable income stream, even if the yields on these instruments are generally lower compared to riskier investments. The increased fair value in fixed maturities may reflect both market conditions and possibly higher yields relative to previous periods. Meanwhile, the net realized investment gains actually improved relative to the 2022 level (from a loss of $204 million to a loss of only $105 million), suggesting that while market volatility may have affected realized gains, the steady increase in periodic investment income was able to boost overall profitability.\n\nIn summary, although detailed yield data by asset class is not provided, the shifts observed—increases in both fixed maturities and short-term securities—appear to have positively contributed to the net investment income. This enhancement in the income stream from investments supports overall profitability by supplementing core underwriting earnings. Thus, the composition changes and improved fair values, especially in the fixed income sectors, are aligned with the observed improvement in net investment income and, by extension, overall profitability."

This progression suggests several points regarding management’s view:\n\n1. Market Dynamics and Timing: The lower average price early in the repurchase cycle could indicate that management viewed shares as attractive when the price was comparatively lower. As the market price increased over time, repurchases continued, albeit at higher prices, suggesting that management believed the company’s intrinsic or long-term value justified buying at elevated levels once adequate volume was available or when market conditions shifted.\n\n2. Confidence in Value: The willingness to repurchase shares even as prices rose implies that management is confident in Ulta Beauty’s fundamentals. They may perceive the shares as still undervalued relative to the company’s growth prospects, profitability, or competitive positioning, thus justifying the buyback even at higher prices.\n\n3. Flexibility in Execution: The variation in prices also hints at a timing strategy rather than a strict price threshold. Management appears to be opportunistic, executing repurchases based on market liquidity and pricing windows rather than waiting for a single target price. This demonstrates flexibility in capital allocation, balancing the desire to reduce outstanding shares with the need to take advantage of available market conditions.\n\nIn summary, the rising average repurchase prices reflect that while management capitalized on more attractive prices initially, they were prepared to continue buybacks as market prices increased, indicating a strong belief in the underlying value of the company and a confirmation that the stock remains an attractive use of excess cash despite short‐term market fluctuations."

        "We are subject to various cybersecurity risks in connection with our business. For more information on our cybersecurity related risks, see the section entitled “Risks Related to Our Business Operations and Industry” in Item 1A of this Annual Report.\n\nOur Approach\n\nPTC takes a holistic, multi-layered approach to cybersecurity and privacy that combines traditional Defense-in-Depth methods with next-generation Zero Trust principles. In today’s globally interconnected world, we consider every entry point on the attack surface critical, and we aim to secure the points under our control. In developing our cybersecurity risk management program, we are informed by industry benchmarks and standards, including the cybersecurity framework created by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (“NIST”). We also have various security-related certifications and authorizations, including ISO 27001, SOC 2 Type II and FedRAMP, for certain of our products and services.\n\nPeople. PTC recognizes that technology alone cannot mitigate all security threats, so we focus on developing our most critical resource: our people. Security is the responsibility of everyone employed by PTC and is independent of departmental affiliation. PTC’s corporate cybersecurity awareness activities are combined with enterprise-wide and department-specific tools and mandatory employee training, providing everyone employed by PTC with the knowledge and resources to support our efforts to mitigate security threats. \n\nProcess. An educated workforce needs a governance framework to guide and monitor its activities. PTC has processes and policies in place to try to anticipate security risks and facilitate compliance with applicable contractual obligations, regulations and standards, as well as address any incidents or violations. PTC focuses on continuous improvement and is constantly maturing its processes to keep pace with the rapidly evolving cybersecurity threat landscape. \n\nTechnology. PTC seeks to automate these processes and remove the potential for human error to the extent feasible by implementing technology solutions. From fundamental IT security to development of our software products and keeping our customers’ data safe in the cloud, PTC aims to maintain a secure infrastructure that is continuously monitored for possible threats. \n\nThese three key elements of people, process, and technology are tightly interwoven to support our aim to secure our environments and data.\n\nGovernance \n\nCybersecurity is a risk area with oversight at the highest levels of the organization, including the Executive and Board Level. The overall operational program is led by the Cybersecurity Strategy Council, a cross-functional team of executives and subject matter experts, including our Chief Product Security Officer, Chief Information Security Officer and Chief Compliance Officer. The Cybersecurity Strategy Council oversees a “Three Lines Model” of Operations, Risk Monitoring and Oversight, and Audit, to effectively address cybersecurity, risk management and control.  All Cybersecurity, Risk and Internal Audit functions report to the PTC Executive Leadership Team. PTC’s Cybersecurity Program is supported by robust processes and procedures at all levels. Our matrixed cybersecurity organization is governed by industry-standard frameworks, and to ensure that they are executed, we involve the Executive Leadership Team, the Cybersecurity Strategy Council, and business unit security leads and cybersecurity analysts across the enterprise. We provide regular updates on our cybersecurity strategic plans, programs, and initiatives, and vulnerabilities and any applicable remediation efforts to the Cybersecurity Committee of the Board of Directors at its four regularly scheduled meetings per year. Our Incident Response Plans provide for notice, and continued updates, to the Cybersecurity Committee of applicable incidents on a timely basis. Ongoing program assessments are performed to monitor progress and identify opportunities for growth.\n\nRisk Assessment\n\nPTC conducts an annual cybersecurity maturity assessment. Periodically, we engage a third-party security consulting firm to conduct an Enterprise Security Maturity Assessment. This independent assessment provides a mechanism to benchmark our current risk profile and enables us to measure progress as we make program improvements. Identified cybersecurity risks are reviewed by the Cybersecurity Strategy Council, which ensures that risk tolerances are established and used to appropriately manage risks.\n\nThird-Party Vendor Risk Management\n\nOur Vendor Risk Management (VRM) program supports PTC in meeting its cybersecurity, privacy, regulatory and compliance obligations and managing risk associated with third-party vendors who have access to PTC IT systems and data. Prior to outsourcing or allowing third-party access to PTC or customer systems, IP, or data; risks associated with such activity are clearly identified and documented. The process of selecting a third-party vendor includes due diligence of the vendor service or product in question. Third-party companies using PTC facilities or accessing PTC’s IT Systems are subject to PTC’s VRM review and are required to demonstrate that proper security measures are in place before they have access to any PTC IT systems or data. All such vendors are to be approved by PTC’s VRM process and contractually bound to maintain appropriate cybersecurity technical and organization measures and to protect PTC’s data to which they may have access.\n\nIncident Response\n\nPTC maintains a formal Cybersecurity Incident Response Policy to address cybersecurity incidents. The Policy is tested on a regular basis, including a continuous improvement program involving periodic tabletop exercises. Cybersecurity incident handling is managed by individual organizations with cybersecurity responsibility and monitored/guided by applicable corporate functions. All Cybersecurity Incident Response Plans under the Policy are based on industry standards, such as the NIST Computer Security Incident Handling Guide – Special Publication 800-61.\n\nManagement’s Role in Assessing and Managing Our Risks from Cybersecurity Threats\n\nOur Cybersecurity Program is overseen by executives on our Executive Leadership Team and managed by our Cybersecurity Strategy Council, including our Senior Vice President, Chief Information Security Officer (CISO), who reports to our Executive Vice President, Chief Digital Officer (CDO). Our CISO is responsible for day-to-day risk management activities, including staying informed about and monitoring prevention, detection, mitigation, and remediation efforts through regular communication and reporting from professionals in the information security team, and the use of technological tools and software. Our CDO is responsible for our broader IT program, which includes PTC’s ability to remediate and recover from a cybersecurity incident while reducing impacts to the business and operations. Our CDO and CISO regularly report directly to the Cybersecurity Committee of the Board of Directors on our Cybersecurity Program and efforts to prevent, detect, mitigate, and remediate issues. In addition, we have an escalation process in place to inform senior management and the Cybersecurity Committee and the Board of Directors of material issues. Management Experience\n\nOur CDO and CISO have extensive experience assessing and managing cybersecurity programs and cybersecurity risk. Our CDO joined PTC as Chief Digital Officer in January 2022 and is responsible for PTC’s global information technology (IT) team, overseeing PTC’s digital infrastructure and working with business leaders to guide PTC’s digital process optimization strategy. He has more than two decades of IT and operations leadership. Before joining PTC, he served as Global Vice President and Chief Information Officer for Avaya, where he led a globally-dispersed team of 1,200 IT professionals to support the entire global Avaya enterprise. Prior to Avaya, he held technology leadership roles at Arise Virtual Solutions Inc., Oracle, and Colorado College.\n\nOur CISO joined PTC as Cyber Information Security Officer in April 2022 and, before joining PTC, was the Vice President, Information Technology, North America and Europe for Alorica, where he led Alorica’s transformation to a secure endpoint architecture for 90,000 global remote and hybrid employees."

      "ground_truth": "The question is answerable using the information provided. Future changes in accounting judgments, such as whether to combine or separate performance obligations, can have several important impacts on eBay Inc.'s financial health and reported revenue growth. For example:\n\n1. **Revenue Recognition Timing**: A change in judgment could shift when revenue is recognized. If more transactions are accounted for as combined performance obligations (thus deferring revenue recognition) rather than separate, it might delay revenue recognition. This could lead to slower reported revenue growth in the short term even if customer activity remains unchanged.\n\n2. **Reported Revenue Amounts**: Deciding whether to separately identify distinct obligations and accurately assign their standalone selling prices could result in higher or lower upfront revenue. For instance, recognizing revenue gross versus net changes how much revenue appears on the income statement, potentially affecting key growth metrics.\n\n3. **Comparability and Trend Analysis**: Changes in accounting interpretations can impair the comparability of financial data over time. Analysts might find it challenging to assess the company’s performance if a change in the method of grouping or pricing performance obligations substantially alters historical metrics.\n\n4. **Impact on Profitability and Risk Assessment**: Since revenue forms the top line, any shifts in its measurement can affect downstream profitability ratios. A deferral of revenue recognition due to accounting changes might influence the company’s earnings timing, affecting risk assessments, investor sentiment, and market valuation. Investors may re-evaluate eBay’s competitive positioning if reported margins or cash flows appear less robust due to altered recognition practices.\n\nOverall, while changes in accounting judgments may not affect the underlying economic performance of the business, they can materially affect measured revenue growth and the perception of financial health. The company would need to clearly disclose these changes and their potential impacts to ensure transparency and maintain investor confidence."

We focus on providing comprehensive resources for the full breadth of process control, process-enabling and yield management solutions for manufacturing and testing wafers and reticles, a wide variety of ICs, PCBs, IC substrates and packaging as well as general materials research. Our revenues are derived primarily from product sales and related service contracts, mostly through our direct sales force.\nWe believe that the size and location of our field sales, service engineering, applications engineering, and marketing organizations represent a competitive advantage in our served markets. We have direct sales forces in Asia, the U.S. and Europe. We maintain an export compliance program designed to meet the requirements of Commerce and the U.S. Department of State and the trade regulations of the international jurisdictions in which we operate.\nIn addition to sales and service offices in the U.S., we conduct sales, marketing and services out of subsidiaries or branches in many regions; some of the largest include China, Germany, Israel, Japan, Korea, Singapore, Taiwan and the United Kingdom. We believe sales outside the U.S. will continue to be a significant percentage of our total revenues. International revenues accounted for approximately 89%, 88% and 90% of our total revenues in the fiscal years ended June 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Additional information regarding our revenues from foreign operations for our last three fiscal years can be found in Note 19 “Segment Reporting and Geographic Information” to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nInternational sales and operations may be adversely affected by the imposition of governmental controls, restrictions on export technology, political instability, trade restrictions, changes in tariffs and the difficulties associated with staffing and managing international operations. In addition, international sales may be adversely affected by the economic conditions in each country and by fluctuations in currency exchange rates. Such fluctuations may negatively impact our ability to compete on price with local providers or the value of revenues we generate from our international business. Although we attempt to manage some of the currency risk inherent in non-U.S. dollar product sales through hedging activities, there can be no assurance that such efforts will be adequate. These factors, as well as any of the other risk factors related to our international business and operations that are described in Item 1A “Risk Factors,” could have a material adverse effect on our future business and financial results."

Second, they assume that any potential losses that can be estimated and are probable have already been appropriately recorded as liabilities, meaning that any undisclosed exposures are not considered significant relative to the company’s overall financial condition, liquidity, or operating results. Third, this statement implies an assumption that their internal risk assessments and legal evaluations have adequately captured all significant uncertainties related to these proceedings, and that any potential adverse outcomes will remain within a manageable range. Finally, management likely assumes that external factors, including regulatory interpretations and the eventual resolution of these disputes, will not shift dramatically in favor of outcomes that could jeopardize the company’s financial stability.

      "ground_truth": "Investors may interpret Chevron’s decision to repurchase $14.9 billion of its common stock as a strong signal of management’s confidence in the company’s future performance. When management allocates such a significant amount toward share buybacks, it generally indicates that they believe the company’s shares are undervalued in the market. This can be seen as an assertion that the current market price does not fully reflect the company’s underlying fundamentals, growth prospects, or cash flow generation capabilities. Moreover, the repurchase might be viewed as a strategic move to improve earnings per share (EPS) by reducing the outstanding share count, which can potentially enhance shareholder value over time.\n\nWhile the repurchase does not directly guarantee future performance, it suggests that management is committed to returning excess cash to shareholders rather than deploying it elsewhere, which can be interpreted as a vote of confidence in the firm’s operational strength and competitive positioning. Investors might also infer that the company’s financial health is robust enough to support both its capital investments and significant stock repurchases.\n\nIn summary, the repurchase is seen as a positive signal that management believes the company is well positioned for future growth and that the stock is undervalued at the current market valuation."

This implies that so far Sempra has repurchased the difference between the original authorization limits and the remaining capacity. In dollar terms, $2 billion - $1.25 billion = $750 million has been used for repurchasing shares. In terms of shares, 25,000,000 - 19,632,529 = approximately 5,367,471 shares have been repurchased.

        "Factoring. We have factoring agreements with financial institutions to sell certain of our trade receivables and promissory notes from customers without recourse. We do not believe we are at risk for any material losses as a result of these agreements. In addition, we periodically sell certain LC, without recourse, received from customers in payment for goods and services.\nThe following table shows total receivables sold under factoring agreements and proceeds from sales of LC for the indicated periods:\nYear Ended June 30,\n(In thousands)\t2024\t\t2023\t\t2022\nReceivables sold under factoring agreements\t$\t254,889 \t\t\t$\t328,933 \t\t\t$\t250,983 \t\nProceeds from sales of LC\t$\t22,242 \t\t\t$\t69,247 \t\t\t$\t151,924 \t\n \nFactoring and LC fees for the sale of certain trade receivables were recorded in Other expense (income), net and were not material for the periods presented.\nPurchase Commitments. We maintain commitments to purchase inventory from our suppliers as well as goods, services, and other assets in the ordinary course of business. Our liability under these purchase commitments is generally restricted to a forecasted time-horizon as mutually agreed between the parties. This forecasted time-horizon can vary among different suppliers. Our estimate of our significant purchase commitments primarily for material, services, supplies and asset purchases is $2.17 billion as of June 30, 2024, a majority of which will be due within the next 12 months. Actual expenditures will vary based upon the volume of the transactions and length of contractual service provided. In addition, the amounts paid under these arrangements may be less in the event that the arrangements are renegotiated or canceled. Certain agreements provide for potential cancellation penalties.\nCash LTI Plan. As of June 30, 2024, we have committed $143.1 million for future payment obligations under our Cash LTI Plan. Cash LTI awards issued to employees under the Cash LTI Plan vest in three or four equal installments, with one-third or one-fourth of the aggregate amount of the Cash LTI award vesting on each anniversary of the grant date over a three or four-year period. In order to receive payments under a Cash LTI award, participants must be employed by us as of the applicable award vesting date.\nGuarantees and Contingencies. We maintain guarantee arrangements available through various financial institutions for up to $83.9 million, of which $49.9 million had been issued as of June 30, 2024, primarily to fund guarantees to customs authorities for value-added tax and other operating requirements of our consolidated subsidiaries in Europe, Israel and Asia.\nIndemnification Obligations. Subject to certain limitations, we are obligated to indemnify our current and former directors, officers and employees with respect to certain litigation matters and investigations that arise in connection with their service to us. These obligations arise under the terms of our certificate of incorporation, bylaws, applicable contracts, and Delaware and California law. The obligation to indemnify generally means that we are required to pay or reimburse the individuals’ reasonable legal expenses and possibly damages and other liabilities incurred by several of our current and former directors, officers and employees in connection with these matters. For example, we have paid or reimbursed legal expenses incurred in connection with the investigation of our historical stock option practices and the related litigation and government inquiries. Although the maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under the indemnification obligations generally described in this paragraph is theoretically unlimited, we believe the fair value of this liability, to the extent estimable, is appropriately considered within the reserve we have established for currently pending legal proceedings.\nWe are a party to a variety of agreements pursuant to which we may be obligated to indemnify the other party with respect to certain matters. Typically, these obligations arise in connection with contracts and license agreements or the sale of assets, under which we customarily agree to hold the other party harmless against losses arising therefrom, or provide customers with other remedies to protect against, bodily injury or damage to personal property caused by our products, non-compliance with our product performance specifications, infringement by our products of third-party IP rights and a breach of warranties, representations and covenants related to matters such as title to assets sold, validity of certain IP rights, non-infringement of third-party rights, and certain income tax-related matters. In each of these circumstances, payment by us is typically subject to the other party making a claim to and cooperating with us pursuant to the procedures specified in the particular contract. This usually allows us to challenge the other party’s claims or, in case of breach of IP representations or covenants, to control the defense or settlement of any third-party claims brought against the other party. Further, our obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of amounts, activity (typically at our option to replace or correct the products or terminate the agreement with a refund to the other party), and duration. In some instances, we may have recourse against third parties and/or insurance covering certain payments made by us.\nIn addition, we may, in limited circumstances, enter into agreements that contain customer-specific commitments on pricing, tool reliability, spare parts stocking levels, response time and other commitments. Furthermore, we may give these customers limited audit or inspection rights to enable them to confirm that we are complying with these commitments. If a customer elects to exercise its audit or inspection rights, we may be required to expend significant resources to support the audit or inspection, as well as to defend or settle any dispute with a customer that could potentially arise out of such audit or inspection. To date, we have made no significant accruals in our Consolidated Financial Statements for this contingency. While we have not in the past incurred significant expenses for resolving disputes regarding these types of commitments, we cannot make any assurance that it will not incur any such liabilities in the future.\nIt is not possible to predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under these or similar agreements due to the conditional nature of our obligations and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. Historically, payments made by us under these agreements have not had a material effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows."

      "ground_truth": "The provided data allows us to evaluate the contingent liabilities associated with the guarantee arrangements. KLA Corporation has guarantee arrangements available for up to $83.9 million, of which $49.9 million had already been issued as of June 30, 2024. These guarantees are primarily to support customs and tax requirements (including value‐added tax) for the company’s subsidiaries in Europe, Israel, and Asia. While these are contingent liabilities that are not recorded on the balance sheet as actual debt, they pose several risk exposures:\n\n1. Contingent Cash Outflows: If any of the subsidiaries fail to meet their customs or tax obligations, or if a triggering event occurs (such as a default or regulatory non-compliance), KLA could be called upon to fulfill these guarantees. This would result in an immediate cash outflow which could affect the company’s short‑term liquidity and cash flows, especially given that a majority of these commitments are upcoming within the next 12 months.\n\n2. Financial Stability and Liquidity Risk: While $49.9 million might seem modest in isolation, in a scenario of broader economic stress or operational issues within one or more regions, the triggering of these guarantees could contribute to financial instability. Sudden cash requirements might force the company to reallocate capital, affect working capital ratios, or even necessitate external financing at less favorable terms.\n\n3. Regulatory and Operational Risk: The guarantees are linked to customs and tax requirements. Should there be changes in these regulatory environments or heightened enforcement in any of the covered regions, KLA may face increased likelihood that these contingent liabilities will be activated. This adds an operational risk component, as the company needs to continually manage compliance across multiple jurisdictions.\n\n4. Impact on Earnings Volatility: Although historically these guarantees have not had a material effect on operations, any future event that triggers payment under these arrangements could lead to unexpected expenses. This may result in earnings volatility and potentially higher costs of capital if investors perceive increased risks.\n\nIn summary, while the issued guarantees have not yet become an actual liability and the company believes they do not currently pose material risk, there is an inherent exposure to contingent liabilities. The potential impact relates primarily to cash flow pressures and liquidity if the guarantees are called upon, which in turn could stress financial stability under adverse conditions."

Revenue Composition and Profitability: \n   • Investment banking revenues (around 85–90% of the part of revenue from contracts with clients) tend to be high‐margin during favorable market conditions but can be cyclical in nature. \n   • Investment management revenues (about 95% of the respective underlying revenue, as noted) are typically more stable and predictable due to fee-based structures.

Together, these segments contribute approximately 45%–50% of total non-interest revenues depending on the year, providing a diversified base.\n\n2. Impact on Profitability and Risk Profile:\n   • Profitability: A diversified revenue base that includes both volatile, high-margin (investment banking) and more stable, fee-based (investment management, commissions & fees) income streams helps balance overall profitability. In good market conditions, the high margin of investment banking can boost profitability significantly. In more volatile periods, the steady fees from investment management and commissions can cushion the impact.\n   • Risk Profile: The investments in banking activities tend to be subject to market fluctuations, regulatory changes, and economic cycles, which increases the firm’s operational risk. On the other hand, the more recurring fee-based revenue streams reduce volatility. Therefore, the mix contributes to risk mitigation by not overly relying on one highly cyclical segment.\n\n3. Summary: \n   • The substantial exposure to investment banking implies that while the firm can generate high returns during favorable conditions, it also bears higher market-related risks. \n   • The strong presence of investment management and commissions & fees, due to their stable fee structures, provides a steady revenue foundation, balancing the risk and improving overall resilience.\n\nOverall, this revenue breakdown suggests that while the firm may experience profit volatility due to the cyclical nature of investment banking, the stabilizing influence of investment management and commissions helps maintain a balanced risk profile. These qualitative insights can guide further detailed quantitative analysis if additional profitability metrics (such as segment-specific margins and cost structures) are provided."

At the same time, property, plant, and equipment (PPE) grew from $1,031 million to $1,074 million—a more modest increase of roughly 4%—suggesting that the company is investing in its productive capacity and infrastructure judiciously.\n\nThis pattern can be interpreted as Brown‐Forman positioning itself for future growth by making targeted capital investments that support operational efficiency and potentially higher margins. The increased investment in PPE, albeit modest relative to operating income gains, likely reflects efforts to upgrade production capabilities or expand capacity in a way that boosts productivity without requiring a proportional increase in sales. In essence, the company appears to be reinforcing its operational foundation (through capital improvements) to sustain and possibly drive further profitability improvements in the future.\n\nIn summary, by increasing its PPE while seeing significant improvements in operating income, Brown‐Forman is aligning its capital allocation to enhance productive capacity and efficiency, which positions it well for future growth relative to its current level of operational profitability."

        "We rely heavily on information technology systems to operate and manage all key aspects of our business. We also process substantial volumes of confidential business information and sensitive consumer and employee personal information, which if impacted by cyber threats could result in financial and reputational harms and regulatory sanction. We have developed and implemented, and update on an ongoing basis, a risk-based information security program designed to identify, assess and manage material risks from cybersecurity threats.\n\n \n\nCybersecurity Risk Management and Strategy\n\n \n\nOur information security program comprises administrative, technical and physical safeguards designed, under a risk-based approach, to reasonably mitigate cybersecurity risks to the confidentiality, integrity or availability of our information systems and information. These include safeguards designed to oversee service-provider relationships in a manner consistent with the risks presented by the engagement and use of the service provider.\n\n \n\nThe program deploys multiple layers of controls designed to identify, protect against, detect, respond to and recover from information security and cybersecurity incidents and our Cyber Security Incident Response Team, which is part of our Enterprise Information Protection (“EIP”) organization, plays a core role in detecting, mitigating and remediating cybersecurity incidents. Based on the nature and severity of the incident, our response is to be guided by documented incident response plans. These plans outline steps to be followed, functional areas to be engaged, internal escalations to be pursued (which may include, as appropriate, senior management, executive management and the Board) and stakeholders to be notified.\n\n \n\nThird parties also play a role in our cybersecurity. We engage third parties for advice and support in the design and implementation of certain program elements and leverage third-party tools to help identify and mitigate cybersecurity risks. Certain specific, defined components of our technology environment are assessed by third-party auditors with a view to alignment with industry standards such as, for example, the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards.\n\nWe also periodically retain outside expertise to conduct a maturity assessment of our program against industry standards and participants. Our program is informed by industry standards such as, for example, the National Institute of Standards and Technology’s Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity (“NIST CSF”), but this does not imply that we meet all technical standards, specifications or requirements under the NIST CSF or other sources.\n\n \n\nWe have combatted cybersecurity threats in the normal course of business, but prior cybersecurity incidents have not materially affected, and do not appear likely to materially affect, our operations, business strategy, results of operations or financial condition. However, our Enterprise Risk Management program has recognized that we face ongoing risks from cybersecurity threats that, if not successfully prevented or mitigated, could materially affect us, including our operations, business strategy, results of operations or financial condition. For additional information on this risk, see Item 1A, Risk Factors, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\n \n\nCybersecurity Governance\n\n \n\nOur Board, with oversight by the Audit Committee, oversees management’s processes for identifying and mitigating cybersecurity risks. Executive management including our Chief Information Security Officer (“CISO”), who reports to our General Counsel & Chief Risk Officer, updates the Audit Committee on our cybersecurity posture no less frequently than quarterly and periodically update the full Board.\n\n \n\nOur EIP organization, led by our CISO, is responsible for the design and implementation of our information security program. Our current CISO has been with the Company for more than eight years—serving as our CISO for nearly seven years—and has extensive cybersecurity experience through leadership and consulting roles. His current leadership team comprising seven individuals has over 130 years of combined cybersecurity experience. These and other EIP team members work closely with stakeholders across the Company to implement the program’s policies, standards and processes and help ensure awareness that securing customer information and honoring our privacy promises are core employee obligations, as highlighted in our Code of Ethics and reinforced through our Valuable Information Protection training program."

      "ground_truth": "Adherence to industry standards such as the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF), even if not fully compliant, can enhance Best Buy’s risk management profile and potentially have a favorable influence on its valuation and investor trust in several ways:\n\n1. Improved Cyber Resilience: By aligning its security protocols with a widely recognized framework, Best Buy demonstrates a proactive approach to identifying, mitigating, and managing cybersecurity risks. Although full compliance isn’t achieved, following significant portions of the NIST CSF assures investors that the company is committed to maintaining robust safeguards against emerging threats.\n\n2. Enhanced Risk Visibility and Management: The use of industry standards provides a structured approach to evaluating risks and responding to incidents. This yields greater transparency and consistency in the company’s risk management practices, which may reduce the probability or impact of adverse events. A more controlled and methodical risk management approach often translates into reduced volatility and defensible operational resilience in the eyes of investors.\n\n3. Positive Signaling to Investors: Aligning with a reputable framework helps signal a strong governance posture. Even partial adherence can reassure investors that cybersecurity is being taken seriously at a high management level and that the Board, via oversight, is engaged in overseeing these risks. This can enhance investor confidence and trust, factors that are valued by the market and may contribute to a more favorable cost of capital or valuation multiple.\n\n4. Regulatory and Market Advantages: Using established frameworks can also help the company remain agile in adapting to regulatory changes and evolving industry best practices. Consequently, it mitigates potential regulatory penalties or reputational damage in instances of cybersecurity breaches, which may further support the company’s market valuation.\n\nIn summary, even if Best Buy is not fully compliant with NIST CSF, demonstrating adherence to its core principles signals that the company is rigorously managing its cybersecurity risks. This, in turn, can enhance investor trust and, by reducing perceived risk, might positively affect its valuation, both by insulating against potential losses from cyber incidents and by ensuring continued operational integrity."

In particular, the current ratio and quick ratio can be calculated as follows:\n\n1. Current Ratio = Current Assets / Current Liabilities\n   • For 2023: Current Assets = $1,819,499 thousand and Current Liabilities = $235,035 thousand, so:\n     Current Ratio (2023) ≈ 1,819,499 / 235,035 ≈ 7.74\n   • For 2022: Current Assets = $1,410,619 thousand and Current Liabilities = $263,400 thousand, so:\n     Current Ratio (2022) ≈ 1,410,619 / 263,400 ≈ 5.36\n\n   This shows that the current ratio improved significantly from approximately 5.36 in 2022 to 7.74 in 2023, indicating a stronger ability to cover short-term obligations.\n\n2. Quick Ratio = (Cash + Short-term Investments + Accounts Receivable) / Current Liabilities\n   • For 2023: Cash = $527,843, Short-term Investments = $580,633, and Accounts Receivable = $179,858. Quick Assets = 527,843 + 580,633 + 179,858 = $1,288,334 thousand. Thus:\n     Quick Ratio (2023) ≈ 1,288,334 / 235,035 ≈ 5.48\n   • For 2022: Cash = $288,607, Short-term Investments = $449,266, and Accounts Receivable = $182,714. Quick Assets = 288,607 + 449,266 + 182,714 = $920,587 thousand. Thus:\n     Quick Ratio (2022) ≈ 920,587 / 263,400 ≈ 3.50\n\n   The quick ratio improved from approximately 3.50 in 2022 to 5.48 in 2023, reflecting enhanced liquidity when inventory is excluded from current assets.\n\nThe significant increases in cash and short-term investments are key contributors to these improvements. This enhanced liquidity suggests that the company is in a stronger position to meet its short-term liabilities and financial obligations, reinforcing its overall competitive and financial standing."

        "We face significant competition from major international semiconductor companies, as well as smaller companies focused on specific market niches. Because some of our components include functionality that in some cases may be integrated into more complex ICs, we also face competition from manufacturers of ICs, ASICs and fully-customized ICs, as well as customers who develop their own IC products. See \"Risk Factors—Trends, Risks and Uncertainties Related to Our Business\" included elsewhere in this Form 10-K for additional information.\n\nSome of our competitors have greater financial and other resources to pursue development, engineering, manufacturing, marketing and distribution of their products and may generally be better situated to withstand adverse economic or market conditions. The semiconductor industry has experienced, and may continue to experience, significant consolidation among companies and vertical integration among customers. The following discusses the effects of competition on our three operating segments:\n\nPSG\n\nOur competitive strengths include our core competencies of leading-edge fabrication technologies, micro and module packaging expertise, breadth of product line and IP portfolio, high-quality, cost-effective manufacturing and supply chain management, which helps to ensure supply to our customers. Our commitment to continual innovation allows us to provide an ever-broader range of semiconductor solutions to our customers who differentiate in power density and power efficiency, the key performance characteristics driving our markets.\n\nThe principal methods of competition in our discrete, module and integrated semiconductor products are through new products and package innovations enabling enhanced performance over existing products. Of particular importance are our intelligent power technologies based on silicon and SiC wide band gap technologies, which we use to design, manufacture, and deliver to our customers as bare die, packaged discrete solutions or power module solutions. In addition to our power technologies, we believe our integrated circuit, signal and protection technologies have significant performance advantages over our competition. PSG’s primary competitors include: Infineon Technologies AG (\"Infineon\"), STMicroelectronics N.V. (\"STMicroelectronics\"), Wolfspeed Inc., Texas Instruments Incorporated (\"TI\") and Nexperia BV.\n\nASG\n \nASG principally competes on design experience, manufacturing capability, depth and quality of IP, ability to service customer needs from the design phase to the shipping of a completed product, length of design cycle, longevity of technology support and experience of sales and technical support personnel. Our competitive position with respect to the above basis is enhanced by long-standing relationships with leading direct customers.\nOur ability to compete successfully depends on internal and external variables. These variables include, but are not limited to, the timeliness with which we can develop new products and technologies, product performance and quality, manufacturing yields and availability of supply, customer service, pricing, industry trends and general economic trends. Competitors for certain of ASG's products and solutions include: TI, Analog Devices, Inc., Infineon, STMicroelectronics, Renesas Electronics Corporation, Monolithic Power Systems Inc. and NXP Semiconductors N.V. (\"NXP\").\nISG\n\nISG differentiates itself from the competition through deep technical knowledge and close customer relationships to drive leading edge sensing performance primarily in machine vision applications. ISG has significant imaging experience and was one of the earliest to commercialize CMOS active pixel sensors and introduce CMOS technology in many of our markets. ISG has leveraged this expertise into market-leading positions in automotive and industrial applications, which allows us to offer technical and end-user applications knowledge to help customers develop innovative sensing solutions across a broad range of end-user needs.\n\nCompetitors for certain of ISG's products and solutions include: Sony Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation, Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., and Omnivision Technologies Inc."

In 2023, current assets were $5,644.1 million compared to $5,494.2 million in 2022, while current liabilities were $4,345.8 million in 2023 versus $4,210.4 million in 2022. This results in working capital of approximately $1,298.3 million in 2023 (calculated as $5,644.1M - $4,345.8M) versus about $1,283.8 million in 2022. \n\nKey observations include:\n1. A significant increase in cash and cash equivalents from $598.6 million in 2022 to $919.5 million in 2023 improves liquidity.\n2. Inventories decreased from $1,792.8 million in 2022 to $1,497.2 million in 2023, which not only reduces holding costs but also signals potentially more efficient inventory management.\n\nOverall, while the absolute working capital has seen a modest increase, the improved components—especially the boost in cash and reduction in inventories—suggest a stronger liquidity position. This implies that Ecolab is better positioned to meet its short-term obligations, reducing liquidity risk and enhancing its short-term financial health."

To calculate the percentage, divide recurring revenue by total revenue: (1,297.3 / 1,513.7) ≈ 0.857, which translates to approximately 85.7%.

        "At this time we anticipate current cash and marketable security balances, operating cash flows, together with our credit facilities and other financing sources including commercial paper, credit and bond markets, will be adequate to meet our operating, investing and financing needs. We expect cash provided by operating activities of $1.7 billion and capital expenditures of approximately $700 million in 2024. We currently have $2.5 billion of unused revolving credit agreements, including $1.5 billion effective through 2026 and $1.0 billion effective through December 2024, as well as continued access to the commercial paper markets. We are currently in compliance with all debt covenants and do not have material uncertainty about our ability to maintain compliance in future periods. We continue to utilize available capacity within the Monetization Programs to maintain financial flexibility without negatively impacting working capital.\n\nOur principal source of liquidity is operating cash flows supplemented by borrowings for major acquisitions and other significant transactions. Our cash-generating capability is one of our fundamental strengths and provides us with substantial financial flexibility in meeting operating and investing needs.\n\nWe have historically reported negative working capital primarily as the result of our focus to improve core working capital by reducing our levels of trade receivables and inventory while establishing competitive market-based terms with suppliers. The impacts of the extended customer terms programs and of the monetization programs are included in our calculation of core working capital and are largely offsetting. These programs are all part of our ongoing working capital management.\n\nWe periodically monitor our supplier payment terms to assess whether our terms are competitive and in line with local market terms. To the extent that such assessment indicates that our supplier payment terms are not aligned with local market terms, we may seek to adjust our terms, including extending or shortening our payment due dates as appropriate. Supplier payment term modifications did not have a material impact on our cash flows during 2023, and are not expected to have a material impact in 2024.\n\nWe have a substantial amount of indebtedness which results in current maturities of long-term debt and notes payable which can have a significant impact on working capital as a result of the timing of these required payments. These factors, coupled with the use of our ongoing cash flows from operations to service our debt obligations, pay dividends, fund acquisition opportunities, and repurchase our common stock, reduce our working capital amounts.\nWe had negative working capital of $1.7 billion and $2.2 billion as of December 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively.  \nWe believe that our operating cash flows, together with our credit facilities and other available debt financing, including commercial paper, will be adequate to meet our operating, investing and financing needs in the foreseeable future. However, there can be no assurance that volatility and/or disruption in the global capital and credit markets will not impair our ability to access these markets on terms acceptable to us, or at all."

First, the company generates strong operating cash flows—projected at approximately $1.7 billion for 2024—which form the backbone of its liquidity. This reliable cash generation is used to fund operations, service debt, pay dividends, and support acquisition opportunities. Additionally, the company has substantial financing flexibility through credit facilities, including $2.5 billion of unused revolving credit (with $1.5 billion extending through 2026 and $1.0 billion through December 2024) and continued access to commercial paper markets. These resources provide a financial cushion that allows Kellanova to meet its debt maturities despite a reported negative working capital of $1.7 billion as of December 30, 2023. Moreover, the negative working capital position itself is partly strategic—it results from efforts to reduce trade receivables and inventory and to negotiate favorable supplier terms, which help to offset the working capital requirement. In summary, the company leverages its operational cash flows and robust financing mechanisms to cover current debt obligations while maintaining overall liquidity and supporting ongoing operations."

        "We derive revenue from the sale of products and services. Revenue is recognized when control of promised products or services is transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those products or services.\nProduct sales include revenue from the sale of products and equipment, which includes our software and software as a service (“SaaS”) product offerings and equipment rentals.\nService sales include revenues from extended warranties, post-contract customer support (“PCS”), maintenance contracts or services, contract labor to perform ongoing service at a customer location, services related to previously sold products, and software implementation services.\nFor revenue related to a product or service to qualify for recognition, we must have an enforceable contract with a customer that defines the goods or services to be transferred and the payment terms related to those goods or services. Further, collection of substantially all consideration for the goods or services transferred must be probable based on the customer’s intent and ability to pay the promised consideration. We apply judgment in determining the customer’s ability and intention to pay, which is based on a combination of financial and qualitative factors, including the customer’s financial condition, collateral, debt-servicing ability, past payment experience, and credit bureau information.\nCustomer allowances and rebates, consisting primarily of volume discounts and other short-term incentive programs, are considered in determining the transaction price for the contract. These allowances and rebates are reflected as a reduction in the contract transaction price. Significant judgment is exercised in determining product returns, customer allowances, and rebates, and are estimated based on historical experience and known trends.\nMost of our sales contracts contain standard terms and conditions. We evaluate contracts to identify distinct goods and services promised in the contract (performance obligations). Sometimes this evaluation involves judgment to determine whether the goods or services are highly dependent on or highly interrelated with one another, or whether such goods or services significantly modify or customize one another. Certain customer arrangements include multiple performance obligations, typically hardware, software, SaaS, implementation/installation, training, consulting, other services, and/or PCS. Generally, these elements are delivered within the same reporting period, except SaaS, PCS, and other services. We allocate the contract transaction price to each performance obligation on a relative standalone selling price basis. We estimate standalone selling price using the observable price that the good or service sells for separately in similar circumstances and to similar customers or, if observable price is not available, other methods. Allocating the transaction price to each performance obligation sometimes requires significant judgment.\nRevenue from sales of hardware is recognized when control transfers to the customer, which is generally when the product is shipped. If any significant obligation to the customer with respect to a sales transaction remains to be fulfilled following shipment (typically installation, other services noted above, or acceptance by the customer), revenue recognition is deferred until such obligations have been fulfilled. Further, revenue related to separately priced extended warranty and product maintenance agreements is deferred when appropriate and recognized as revenue over the term of the agreement."

      "ground_truth": "The provided details on revenue recognition indicate that Fortive defers revenue for certain services – such as extended warranties, maintenance contracts, and post-contract customer support – until the related performance obligations have been met. This deferral means that, even if cash is received when the contract is signed or when services are initiated, revenue is not immediately recognized on the income statement. As a result, Fortive’s reported revenue growth in the short term may appear lower because a portion of the cash receipts related to these services is booked as a liability (deferred revenue) rather than as recognized revenue. Over time, as the services are delivered, the deferred revenue is gradually recognized, contributing to revenue growth in those future periods.\n\nIn terms of future cash flow projections, the deferral does not affect cash flows directly. The cash from these contracts is often received upfront or on a periodic basis, meaning that while the revenue appears deferred in the financial statements, the actual cash inflows occur earlier. This creates a timing difference where Fortive’s cash flow from operations may be robust even if revenue recognition is spread out over multiple periods. Analysts need to account for these timing differences when projecting future cash flows and profitability, ensuring they understand that the deferred revenue liability represents revenue that will eventually be recognized while the cash has already been collected.\n\nKey insights:\n• Reported revenue growth may be lower in the periods when cash is received but revenue is deferred, since recognition is spread over the term of the service contracts.\n• The deferral mechanism supports a predictable and recurring revenue stream in the long run, thereby aiding in stable future revenue forecasts.\n• There is a disconnect between revenue recognition and cash collection timing, so robust cash flows may exist even when revenue appears to grow at a slower pace.\n\nThus, while deferral moderates short-term revenue growth figures, it also provides a clearer picture of service delivery over time and supports firmer future cash flow projections."

Given his recent appointment (effective December 2023) and his longstanding experience with the company (having served as Executive Vice President and General Counsel since January 2015), this change implies a strategic intent to strengthen oversight of legal, regulatory, and risk management matters. From a strategic risk management perspective, having a seasoned executive in these dual roles enhances the company's ability to identify and mitigate legal and compliance risks, which can be critical in a heavily regulated industry. This move may also signal that the company is positioning itself to better manage potential litigation and regulatory challenges, thereby reducing uncertainties and protecting its financial health over the long term.\n\nFrom a financial health standpoint, integrating the responsibilities of corporate governance and legal oversight under an experienced executive supports improved decision-making related to capital allocation and risk assessment. Even though the reference does not provide numerical financial data, it is reasonable to infer that such a consolidation of roles, when led by a trusted insider, can lead to better alignment between the company’s risk management framework and its financial strategy. This, in turn, can translate into more stable financial performance, potentially minimizing costly legal liabilities and enhancing investor confidence."

      "ground_truth": "Across the fourth quarter of 2023, Devon Energy’s share repurchase activity varied noticeably by month. In October, only 2 shares were repurchased at an average price of $46.49, a negligible amount when compared to the later months. November saw a significant increase with 2,918 shares repurchased at an average price of $45.27, while December’s repurchase volume was slightly lower at 2,549 shares with an average price of $45.05. The higher volumes in November and December suggest that the company intensified its repurchase activity during these months, potentially taking advantage of lower market prices as indicated by the gradual decrease in the average price per share. Overall, these variations imply a repurchase strategy that is responsive to market conditions: limited activity in October followed by more aggressive buying at progressively lower prices later in the quarter, which may reflect a strategic move to optimize the cost and timing of share repurchases."

The investment components of these service agreements are in the form of mutual fund offerings. In addition, plan sponsor retirement plan trust and custody services are also available through our trust company. Individual retirement accounts (“IRAs”) are offered through Principal Bank. Furthermore, services and trust agreements are offered to non-retirement customers including insurance companies, endowments and other financial institutions.\n\nAdministrative service fee revenues are earned for administrative activities performed for the defined contribution retirement plans including recordkeeping and reporting as well as trust and custody, asset management and investment services. Administrative service fee revenues are earned for administrative activities performed for non-retirement plan customers including trust and custody services, defined benefit administration and investment management activities. The majority of these activities are performed daily over time. Fee-for-service transactions are also provided upon client request. These services are considered distinct or grouped into a bundle until a distinct performance obligation is identified. Some performance obligations are considered a series of distinct services, which are substantially the same and have the same pattern of transfer to the customer.\n\nAdministrative service fee revenues can be based on a fixed contractual rate for these services or can be variable based upon contractual rates applied to the market value of the client’s investments or assets under administration. If the consideration for this series of performance obligations is based on market value, it is considered variable during the billing period as the services are performed over time. The consideration becomes unconstrained and thus recognized as revenue for each billing period’s series of distinct services once the market value of the client’s investments or assets under administration is determined at market close. Additionally, fixed fees and other revenues are recognized point-in-time as fee-for-service transactions upon completion.\nIRAs are primarily funded by retirement savings rolled over from qualified retirement plans. The IRAs are held in savings accounts, money market accounts and certificates of deposit. Deposit account fee revenues are earned as the performance of establishing and maintaining IRA accounts is completed. Fee-for-service transactions are also provided upon client request. The establishment fees and annual maintenance fees are accrued into earnings over a period of time using the average account life. Upfront and recurring bank fees are related to performance obligations that have the same pattern of transfer to the customer and are recognized in income over time with control transferred to the customers utilizing the output method. These fees are based on a fixed contractual rate. Fixed fees and other revenues are also recognized point-in-time as fee-for-service transactions upon completion. Additionally, commission income is earned on advisory services provided to customers. The revenues are earned over time as the service is performed based upon contractual rates applied to the market value of the clients’ portfolios.\n\nThe types of revenues from contracts with customers were as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the year ended December 31,\n\n \n\n\n    \n\n2023\n\n    \n\n2022\n\n    \n\n2021\n\n \n\n\n\n  (in millions)\n\n \n\nAdministrative service fee revenue\n\n\n$\n\n539.5\n\n\n$\n\n537.0\n\n\n$\n\n  576.7 \n\n\nDeposit account fee revenue\n\n\n\n11.3\n\n\n\n10.2\n\n\n\n  9.2 \n\n\nCommission income\n\n\n\n1.9\n\n\n\n1.2\n\n\n\n  0.7 \n\n\nOther fee revenue\n\n\n \n\n3.6\n\n\n \n\n3.0\n\n\n \n\n  3.5 \n\n\nTotal revenues from contracts with customers\n\n\n \n\n556.3\n\n\n \n\n551.4\n\n\n \n\n  590.1 \n\n\nFees and other revenues not within the scope of revenue recognition guidance\n\n\n \n\n1,118.7\n\n\n \n\n1,114.0\n\n\n \n\n  1,226.9 \n\n\nTotal fees and other revenues\n\n\n \n\n1,675.0\n\n\n \n\n1,665.4\n\n\n \n\n  1,817.0 \n\n\nPremiums and other considerations\n\n\n \n\n2,935.0\n\n\n \n\n1,959.7\n\n\n \n\n  1,883.6 \n\n\nNet investment income\n\n\n \n\n2,640.2\n\n\n \n\n2,274.1\n\n\n \n\n  2,728.8 \n\n\nTotal operating revenues\n\n\n$\n\n7,250.2\n\n\n$\n\n5,899.2\n\n\n$\n\n  6,429.4 \n\n\n\nPrincipal Asset Management\n\nFees and other revenues earned for asset management, investment advisory and distribution services provided to institutional and retail clients in addition to trustee and/or administrative services performed for retirement savings plans. Fees are based largely upon contractual rates applied to the specified amounts of the clients’ portfolios. Each service is a distinct performance obligation; however, if the services are not distinct on their own, we combine them into a distinct bundle or we have a series of distinct services that are substantially the same and have the same pattern of transfer to the customer. Fees and other revenues received for performance obligations such as asset management and other services are typically recognized over time utilizing the output method as the service is performed. Performance fees and transaction fees on certain accounts are recognized in income when the probability of significant reversal will not occur upon resolution of the uncertainty, which could be based on a variety of factors such as market performance or other internal metrics. Asset management fees are accrued each month based on the fee terms within the applicable agreement and are generally billed quarterly when values used for the calculation are available. Management fees and performance fees are variable consideration as they are subject to fluctuation based on assets under management (“AUM”) and other constraints. These fees are not recognized until unconstrained at the end of each reporting period.\n\nIncentive-based fees are recognized in income when the probability of significant reversal will not occur upon the resolution of the uncertainty, which is based on market performance.\n\nFees for managing customers’ mandatory retirement savings accounts in Latin America are collected with each monthly deposit made by our customers. If a customer stops contributing before retirement age, we collect no fees but services are still provided. We recognize revenue from these contracts as services are performed over the life of the contract and review annually.\nThe types of revenues from contracts with customers were as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the year ended December 31,\n\n \n\n\n    \n\n2023\n\n    \n\n2022\n\n    \n\n2021\n\n \n\n\n\n(in millions)\n\n \n\nPrincipal Global Investors:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nManagement fee revenue\n\n\n$\n\n1,372.0\n\n\n$\n\n1,434.6\n\n\n$\n\n  1,514.1 \n\n\nOther fee revenue\n\n\n \n\n182.1\n\n\n \n\n240.4\n\n\n \n\n  273.8 \n\n\nTotal revenues from contracts with customers\n\n\n\n1,554.1\n\n\n \n\n1,675.0\n\n\n \n\n  1,787.9 \n\n\nFees and other revenues not within the scope of revenue recognition guidance\n\n\n\n24.9\n\n\n \n\n27.4\n\n\n \n\n  36.2 \n\n\nTotal fees and other revenues\n\n\n\n1,579.0\n\n\n \n\n1,702.4\n\n\n \n\n  1,824.1 \n\n\nNet investment income\n\n\n\n32.2\n\n\n \n\n13.1\n\n\n \n\n  3.9 \n\n\nTotal operating revenues\n\n\n$\n\n1,611.2\n\n\n$\n\n1,715.5\n\n\n$\n\n  1,828.0 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the year ended December 31,\n\n \n\n\n    \n\n2023\n\n    \n\n2022\n\n    \n\n2021\n\n \n\n\n \n\n(in millions)\n\n\nPrincipal International:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nManagement fee revenue\n\n\n$\n\n448.1\n\n\n$\n\n417.1\n\n\n$\n\n484.4\n\n\nOther fee revenue\n\n\n \n\n8.4\n\n\n \n\n9.2\n\n\n \n\n8.3\n\n\nTotal revenues from contracts with customers\n\n\n \n\n456.5\n\n\n \n\n426.3\n\n\n \n\n492.7\n\n\nFees and other revenues not within the scope of revenue recognition guidance\n\n\n \n\n5.8\n\n\n \n\n4.5\n\n\n \n\n4.2\n\n\nTotal fees and other revenues\n\n\n \n\n462.3\n\n\n \n\n430.8\n\n\n \n\n496.9\n\n\nPremiums and other considerations\n\n\n \n\n29.0\n\n\n \n\n77.7\n\n\n \n\n127.5\n\n\nNet investment income\n\n\n \n\n701.5\n\n\n \n\n980.9\n\n\n \n\n766.7\n\n\nTotal operating revenues\n\n\n$\n\n1,192.8\n\n\n$\n\n1,489.4\n\n\n$\n\n1,391.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRevenues from contracts with customers by region:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n  \n\n\n \n\n  \n\n\nLatin America\n\n\n$\n\n346.9\n\n\n$\n\n315.2\n\n\n$\n\n364.0\n\n\nAsia\n\n\n \n\n110.4\n\n\n \n\n111.5\n\n\n \n\n129.6\n\n\nEliminations\n\n\n \n\n(0.8)\n\n\n \n\n(0.4)\n\n\n \n\n(0.9)\n\n\nTotal revenues from contracts with customers\n\n\n$\n\n456.5\n\n\n$\n\n426.3\n\n\n$\n\n492.7\n\n\n\nBenefits and Protection\n\nFees and other revenues are earned for administrative services performed including recordkeeping and reporting services for fee-for-service products, nonqualified benefit plans, separate accounts and dental networks.

These costs, along with costs that are not deferrable, are included in operating expenses on the consolidated statements of operations.\n\nDeferred contract costs consist primarily of commissions and variable compensation. We amortize capitalized contract costs on a straight-line basis over the expected contract life, reflecting lapses as they are incurred. Deferred contract costs are subject to impairment testing on an annual basis, or when a triggering event occurs that could warrant an impairment. To the extent future revenues less future maintenance expenses are not adequate to cover the asset balance, an impairment is recognized. For the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, $38.3 million, $35.5 million and $32.4 million, respectively, of amortization expense was recorded in operating expenses on the consolidated statements of operations and no impairment loss was recognized in relation to the costs capitalized."

      "ground_truth": "The provided information allows us to assess the impact of using the output method for recognizing revenues, particularly for administrative service fees and bundled services under long-term contracts such as defined contribution retirement plans and IRAs. In these arrangements, the company applies the output method by recognizing revenue over the period in which services are rendered. For example:\n\n1. Administrative service fee revenue related to defined contribution retirement plans is earned as the company provides services (like recordkeeping, reporting, custody, and investment management) over time. The output method requires the company to measure progress – often using the market value of assets under administration – which determines the extent of service delivered during the billing period. This approach aligns the timing of revenue recognition with the continuous performance of its contractual obligations.\n\n2. For IRAs, the bundled services (which may include deposit account fee revenue, administration fees, and even commission income on advisory services) are also recognized over time. If the services are part of a bundled arrangement where they are not distinct individually, the revenue is recognized as the combined performance obligations are satisfied. This means that even if fees are based on fixed or variable contractual rates, the output method ensures that revenue is recognized in proportion to the output (or value generated) during the service period.\n\nIn short, by using the output method the company ensures that—especially for long-term contracts—the timing of revenue recognition mirrors the actual delivery of services. This method mitigates timing risks and ensures a more accurate reflection of the economic activity, as revenue is recognized only when its underlying performance obligations have been satisfied. No explicit numerical calculations are required here, as the focus is on the qualitative application of the method rather than quantitative adjustments."

        "Cybersecurity Risk Management and Strategy\nEnterprise risk management (ERM) is an integral part of our business processes and our ERM framework considers cybersecurity risk, alongside other company risks, as part of our overall risk assessment process. We follow an industry-leading\nNational Institute of Standards and Technology cybersecurity framework (NIST CSF) and have developed a comprehensive information security program for assessing, identifying and managing cybersecurity risks that is designed to protect our systems and data from unauthorized access, use or other security impact.\nAs part of our information security program, we continuously monitor and update our information technology networks and infrastructure. We have dedicated internal legal, compliance and information security teams, and leverage consultants and third-party service providers to inform our understanding of the threat landscape and to identify, prevent, detect, address and mitigate risks associated with unauthorized access, misuse, computer viruses and other events that could have a security impact. Our information security strategy focuses on complying with applicable data privacy and protection laws, maintaining the availability of our manufacturing operations, protecting data, detecting and responding to threats, building resiliency and providing a secure foundation for growth and innovation. We invest in industry standard security technology to protect the company’s data and business processes against risk of cybersecurity incidents. Our data security management program includes identity, trust, vulnerability and threat management business processes, as well as adoption of standard data protection policies.\nWe measure our data security effectiveness by benchmarking against industry-accepted methods, presenting the results to our Board and Audit Committee for evaluation, and making improvements based on such evaluation. We maintain and routinely test backup systems and disaster recovery and also have processes in place to prevent disruptions resulting from our implementation of new software and systems. We maintain a third-party cyber risk management process to review and monitor critical suppliers regularly for cybersecurity risk and prescribe remediation activities when necessary.\nWe train our employees through annual security training, phishing simulations and regular communications about timely security topics to enhance their understanding of cybersecurity threats and their ability to identify and escalate potential cybersecurity events. We have a cross-functional crisis management team comprised of business unit and functional leaders and a crisis management plan that includes procedures for identifying, containing and responding to cybersecurity incidents. We engage third-party cybersecurity experts to conduct tabletop exercises with our executive leadership to enhance incident response preparedness.\nOur cybersecurity risk management strategy includes the use of cybersecurity insurance that provides protection against certain potential losses arising from certain cybersecurity incidents; however, such insurance may not insure us against all claims related to security breaches, cyberattacks and other related breaches. The company has previously experienced threats and breaches to its data and systems but has not experienced a breach that had a material impact on its operations or business and has not incurred any material breach-related expenses for the year ended July 28, 2024 that are reasonably likely to materially affect the company or its business strategy, results of operations or financial condition. However, as discussed in “Item 1A. Risk Factors,” specifically the risks under the heading, “We may be adversely impacted by a disruption, failure or security breach of our information technology systems,” cyber threats are constantly evolving and becoming more frequent and sophisticated. Accordingly, no matter how well designed or implemented the company’s information security policies and procedures are, there can be no assurance that these policies and procedures will prevent or limit the impact of a cybersecurity incident.\nCybersecurity Governance\nWe have established oversight mechanisms intended to provide effective cybersecurity governance, risk management, and timely incident response. Our Board, in coordination with the Audit Committee, oversees the company’s ERM process, including the management of risks arising from cybersecurity threats.\nOur Board annually reviews assessments of our information security program under the NIST CSF. It receives benchmarking results of our data security effectiveness and reports from our Chief Technology & Information Officer (CTIO) and Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) on our information security program and recent developments. Our Board has delegated the primary responsibility to oversee cybersecurity matters to the Audit Committee. To fulfill its oversight responsibilities, the Audit Committee reviews the measures implemented by the company to identify and mitigate cybersecurity risks and receives quarterly updates from our CTIO and CISO on the information security program, including the status of significant cybersecurity incidences, the emerging threat landscape, and the status of projects to strengthen the company’s information security posture. The Audit Committee regularly reports to the Board on cybersecurity matters. In addition, we have a crisis management plan and protocols by which certain cybersecurity incidents that meet established reporting thresholds are escalated within the company and, where appropriate, reported promptly to the Audit Committee or Board, with ongoing updates regarding any such incident until it has been addressed. Our risk oversight processes and disclosure controls and procedures are designed to escalate key risks for the Board to analyze for disclosure purposes.\nOur CTIO, a member of our corporate leadership team, oversees the team responsible for leading the enterprise-wide information technology strategy, policy, standards, architecture, and processes. Our CISO, who reports to the CTIO, oversees the dedicated information security team, which works in partnership with the company’s ERM team and corporate audit department as well as consultants as part of an overall internal controls process to monitor cybersecurity threats and prevent, detect, mitigate and remediate cybersecurity incidents. The CTIO has over 35 years of information technology experience,\nincluding serving in strategic planning, oversight and global operation of information systems and technology functions for companies in the food and beverage industries. The CISO has over 25 years of information technology experience, including strategy, execution, and operations of enterprise-wide security programs, including cybersecurity programs, and global information technology infrastructure programs."

      "ground_truth": "The integration of cybersecurity insurance into Campbell Soup Company’s risk management strategy can have a positive impact on investor confidence and the company's overall financial health, particularly during cybersecurity-related disruptions. Here are the key points:\n\n1. Enhanced Risk Mitigation and Reduced Financial Volatility: The insurance provides a layer of financial protection against potential losses from cybersecurity incidents. This means that if an incident were to occur, the company would have some of the costs covered, thereby reducing the unexpected financial hit. Investors often view such measures favorably because they help stabilize earnings and mitigate risk, potentially preserving shareholder value.\n\n2. Improved Perception of Robust Risk Management: The detailed cybersecurity governance framework, including adherence to the NIST Cybersecurity Framework and a structured internal and third-party review process, coupled with the use of cybersecurity insurance, demonstrates proactive risk management. This can increase investor confidence because it signals that the company is prepared for evolving cyber threats and has contingency plans in place.\n\n3. Competitive Positioning and Resilience: With comprehensive coverage and robust incident response protocols in place—as described in the reference—investors might consider the company to be more resilient in facing cyber threats. This resilience could translate into a lower cost of capital and more favorable evaluations of the company’s risk profile by credit rating agencies and investors alike.\n\n4. Limitations and Considerations: While cybersecurity insurance can provide financial relief for certain losses, it's important to note that such policies may not cover all claims related to cybersecurity events. The company’s management of non-insured risks also remains crucial. Investors will be mindful of any coverage gaps. However, when paired with strong internal controls and an effective overall risk management strategy, these limitations tend to be outweighed by the benefits of reduced exposure to potential cyber losses.\n\nOverall, the strategic integration of cybersecurity insurance helps signal to investors that Campbell Soup Company is actively managing its cybersecurity risks. This proactive approach can boost investor confidence, support stability in financial statements, and potentially result in a more favorable assessment of the company’s financial health in the event of cybersecurity disruptions."

Although detailed individual biographies are not provided, the diversity in titles – including a Director and Chairman, Lead Director, Chief Executive Officer and President, and several other directors – suggests that the board has a comprehensive blend of expertise in areas such as strategic oversight, risk management, operational execution, and capital allocation.\n\nKey Insights:\n1. Strategic Oversight & Governance: The presence of experienced leaders (e.g., the Chairman and Lead Director) indicates a strong focus on sound corporate governance, which is essential for guiding long-term growth initiatives. Their oversight ensures that critical decisions on expansion, acquisitions, or major capital expenditures are made with rigorous scrutiny.\n\n2.

Risk Management & Competitive Positioning: A board comprised of members with varied backgrounds is better positioned to identify and mitigate risks across various aspects – from market volatility to regulatory challenges. This ability to anticipate risks supports not only the safeguarding of current assets but also the exploration of new growth avenues.\n\n4. Support for Growth Initiatives: The board’s collective experience, particularly in navigating economic cycles and managing large-scale property investments, supports the company’s ability to capitalize on market opportunities. Their strategic inputs can aid in refining competitive positioning, whether that involves entering new markets or optimizing existing portfolio performance.\n\nIn essence, the board’s blend of leadership, industry-specific expertise, and governance experience is likely to drive initiatives that secure and enhance Essex Property Trust, Inc.'s future growth and competitive stance in the market."

        "Emerson has a cybersecurity risk management program that is designed to assess, identify, manage, and govern material risks from cybersecurity threats. Emerson maintains oversight of its cybersecurity risk management program through a governance structure that includes senior management, the Audit Committee and the Board of Directors (the “Board”). Emerson’s cybersecurity risk management program leverages multiple layers of security controls across the Company’s systems designed to establish risk treatment plans and regularly monitor risks. Emerson maintains cybersecurity policies and standards aligned with industry standard control frameworks and applicable regulations, laws and standards, and a global incident response plan.\n\nEmerson’s Board directly, or through its appropriate committees, provides oversight of management’s efforts to mitigate cybersecurity risk and response to cyber incidents. The Board and/or its appropriate committees receive regular updates on cybersecurity from management and engage in discussions throughout the year, including with subject-matter experts as appropriate, on the function of the Company’s overall cybersecurity program, cybersecurity risks, strategies for addressing these risks and the implementation thereof. The Audit Committee has oversight responsibility for the Company’s enterprise cybersecurity risks. The Board also receives reports on cyber events, as appropriate, including response efforts, legal obligations and outreach and notification to regulators and/or customers when needed, as well as provide guidance to management as appropriate.\n\nEmerson’s Chief Information Security Officer, who has over twenty-five years’ experience in information technology within the engineering and technology industries, with the last fourteen years dedicated to cybersecurity, oversees the Company’s enterprise cybersecurity risk management program. The Chief Information Security Officer leads the global enterprise security team responsible for leading enterprise-wide information security strategy, architecture, processes, as well as assessing, identifying, and managing cybersecurity risks, which is an integrated aspect of our overall enterprise risk management program. The Chief Information Security Officer provides regular updates to senior management on key security performance indicators of our enterprise cybersecurity program. The Chief Information Security Officer also provides quarterly briefings on cybersecurity to the Audit Committee.\n\nEmerson maintains a centralized 24x7x365 global incident response operation, managed by the global enterprise security team, supported by leading cybersecurity tools that detect and respond to threats as they occur. Every detected cyber incident is reviewed and assessed by Emerson’s Computer Incident Response Team in accordance with our incident response plan, which contains documented escalation paths and is regularly tested.\n\nEmerson engages independent third-party cybersecurity experts to evaluate our cybersecurity maturity and test effectiveness of overall cybersecurity controls. To test and reinforce Emerson’s internal cybersecurity processes, the Company utilizes an accredited and independent third party to audit and certify key elements of our primary data centers, cloud environments and our enterprise IT organization. The audits are conducted according to International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 27001 Framework, although this is not meant to imply that we meet all technical standards, specifications or requirements under ISO 27001. In addition to performing periodic, internal security reviews, the Company also conducts cybersecurity tabletop exercises led by third party cybersecurity consulting firms from time to time, with the last such engagement occurring in 2023.\n\nEmerson relies on third-party service providers for certain critical or key infrastructure, solutions, and services across our operations. Emerson has an internal vendor management team that assesses risks from vendors and suppliers that provide, amongst other things, key information and supply chain services to Emerson.\n\nEmerson maintains a Cybersecurity Awareness Team, within the global enterprise security team, responsible for driving a global information security culture through awareness and education programs. It has created company-wide information security policies and procedures, reviews these regularly and makes them electronically available to our employees. The team works closely with subject matter experts to create educational material and communicate best practices to the company through online training, custom video content, simulated phishing attacks and a variety of other targeted touchpoints.\n\nTo date, no risks from cybersecurity threats, including as a result of any previous cybersecurity incidents, have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our business, our business strategy, our results of operations or financial condition. In the event an attack or other intrusion were to be successful, we have a response team of internal and external resources engaged and prepared to respond. See Item 1A - \"Risk Factors\" for additional information."

Risk Mitigation and Prevention: By adhering to established standards (such as the ISO 27001 framework) and leveraging best practices, Emerson proactively identifies and addresses cybersecurity risks before they develop into damaging incidents. This preventive stance reduces the probability of encountering expensive breaches or operational disruptions that could lead to unexpected costs and cash flow volatility.\n\n2. Early Detection and Swift Response: Regular third-party audits and incident response tests ensure that any vulnerabilities or breaches are identified early and handled promptly by a well-prepared incident response team. This minimizes the duration and impact of any cyber incident. Quick containment helps avoid prolonged downtime and expensive recovery measures, thereby protecting cash flow stability.\n\n3. Enhanced Stakeholder Confidence: Consistently applying industry standards and undergoing independent audits signals to investors, customers, and regulators that Emerson is committed to robust cybersecurity. This confidence reduces the risk of reputational damage and maintains investor support, ultimately supporting a more predictable and stable cash environment.\n\n4. Financial Risk Management: By systematically testing their incident response capabilities, Emerson can forecast potential risk scenarios and prepare contingency plans. These measures allow the company to allocate capital more efficiently, ensuring funds are not unexpectedly diverted to remedy cyber incidents. As a result, capital is preserved for growth initiatives and other strategic uses, contributing to overall financial stability.\n\nIn summary, these practices create a resilient operating environment where the risk of financial disruptions is significantly reduced, thereby supporting stable and predictable cash flows."

With total revenues of $52,961 million, these expenses represent approximately (3,612 / 52,961) × 100 ≈ 6.8% of total revenues. This ratio indicates that about 6.8% of every dollar of revenue is absorbed by financing and other non-operating costs. While not overwhelmingly high, this level does have a compressing impact on overall profitability by reducing the income available before taxes. In essence, these expenses slightly lower the net profitability margins, highlighting the importance of managing interest and non-operating costs to ensure stronger overall profitability."

Capital expenditures rose from $450.5 million in 2021 to $644.1 million in 2022 and further to $828.5 million in 2023. At the same time, the total assets showed a steady, albeit more gradual, increase from $13,682.6 million in 2021 to $14,234.6 million in 2022 and $14,545.7 million in 2023. This suggests that while the company is reinvesting more heavily in its operations (through higher capex), its asset base is growing at a slower rate, indicating that new investments are likely focused on enhancing efficiency or capacity rather than a broad asset expansion.\n\nIn addition, the cash and cash equivalents (plus restricted cash) detail an interesting trend. There’s a significant jump from $161.5 million in 2022 to $949.2 million in 2023—despite a relatively lower figure in 2021 of $241.5 million. This substantial increase in cash balances in 2023, concurrent with higher capex, implies that the company has bolstered its liquidity significantly. The larger cash cushion not only supports the ability to fund increasing capital expenditures but also indicates a strong liquidity position that can help mitigate potential risks associated with increased investments.\n\nIn summary, the trends suggest that Vulcan Materials Company is actively investing in growth (as evidenced by rising capital expenditures) while maintaining a stable asset growth and strengthening its liquidity. This alignment indicates a strategic balance between reinvesting in the business to drive future growth and ensuring adequate cash reserves to manage operational risks and potential future investments."

      "ground_truth": "The provided data allow us to assess how the mix of debt instruments affects the bank’s risk profile and capital adequacy, including changes in the amount of qualifying Tier 2 capital. For example:\n\n1. **Senior Notes** – These are unsecured obligations that typically have a higher claim on assets than subordinated liabilities. Their interest rates, maturity structure and hedging arrangements (which are detailed extensively) tend to keep their credit risk relatively low. Because senior notes are paid before subordinated instruments in a default scenario, they impose less risk on the bank’s capital structure. Their impact on risk-weighted assets is calibrated accordingly, helping maintain liquidity and reducing the cost of capital.\n\n2. **Subordinated Debt** – Subordinated debt (including both fixed‐rate and fixed‐/floating-rate instruments) ranks lower in the repayment hierarchy. Their bearing on risk is higher relative to senior debt because, in a bankruptcy, these claims are satisfied only after senior obligations are met. Regulatory frameworks allow a portion of this debt to be included in Tier 2 capital; however, the risk weighting is higher and there are limits on how much can qualify. The fact that Tier 2 capital decreased from $1.9 billion in 2022 to $1.5 billion in 2023 may partly be attributed to changes in the composition or valuation of these subordinated instruments (such as minor reductions in principal balances, changes in market values reflected in mark‐to‐market adjustments as well as hedging modifications) that lower the regulatory capital available under Tier 2.\n\n3. **FHLB Advances** – Advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) are generally collateralized by loans and securities, which reduces the inherent credit risk. However, from a capital perspective, these advances are liabilities that contribute to debt maturity profiles. Because they usually carry lower interest rates (around 5.62% in this case) and are backed by collateral, their risk weight is typically lower. They do not directly contribute to Tier 2 capital but do affect overall leverage and funding risk, thereby indirectly influencing the capital adequacy position.\n\n4. **VIE-Related Notes** – The notes associated with consolidated variable interest entities (VIEs), such as those for automobile and solar loan securitizations, are off the core balance sheet with nonrecourse characteristics. They often carry higher interest rates reflecting their riskier profile. Because they are structured so that third-party holders do not have recourse to general assets of the bank, their risk and associated capital treatment can differ markedly from traditional bank debt. Their potential volatility and the fact that they might require more conservative risk weighting could be one factor in adjustments to the bank’s capital composition.\n\nOverall, the changing mix and valuations of these debt components have a twofold effect on the overall risk profile and capital adequacy. First, instruments with higher risk (like subordinated debt and certain VIE-related notes) require higher capital buffers (albeit limited by regulatory rules) and hence contribute differently to Tier 2 capital than lower-risk senior notes or FHLB advances. Second, the observed decrease in qualifying Tier 2 capital (from $1.9 billion in 2022 to $1.5 billion in 2023) may reflect several factors: differences in the aging on the debt, shifts in the composition (or possible paydowns and maturities) of subordinated debt, adjustments for mark-to-market changes on hedged debt, and risk-weighting adjustments applied by regulators. In sum, while senior debt helps maintain a lower risk profile, the relative proportions and characteristics of subordinated, FHLB, and VIE-related borrowings have led to a reduction in Tier 2 capital, thereby signaling potential areas of increased regulatory capital sensitivity and overall funding risk that management must monitor closely."

      "ground_truth": "The provided repurchase data allows us to glean insights on how ANSYS, Inc. is managing its capital allocation. In 2023, the company repurchased 650,000 shares at an average price of $302.34 per share, costing about $196.5 million, compared to 725,000 shares at $283.38 in 2022 for a total cost of roughly $205.6 million. Despite the slight reduction in the number of shares repurchased (which can be partly attributed to the higher average share price), the company’s continued repurchase activity, combined with 1.1 million shares still available under the program, indicates a disciplined approach to using excess cash. \n\nThese figures reflect a deliberate strategic balance: while ANSYS is actively returning capital to shareholders, it is also retaining sufficient free cash flow to invest in business growth and potential acquisitions. The company’s commentary on its strategy emphasizes that the best use of excess cash includes reinvesting in the business and pursuing complementary opportunities, thus reinforcing that share repurchases are part of a broader capital allocation framework rather than the sole focus. By limiting repurchases to amounts that do not jeopardize available cash for strategic investments, ANSYS is effectively optimizing its cash flows to support both shareholder returns and long-term growth."

Specifically:\n\n1. Coupon Rates and Periodic Interest Expense – The 2020 Notes carry relatively low coupon rates (0.950% to 1.650%), which means the interest expense on these issues is relatively modest. In contrast, the 2023 Notes have significantly higher coupon rates (ranging from 5.125% to 5.500%). Consequently, as the company services its debt, the interest expense on the 2023 Notes will be substantially higher on a per-dollar basis compared to the 2020 Notes.\n\n2. Interest Payment Commitments – The reported maximum commitments for future interest payments indicate that the 2020 Notes, with a maximum commitment of $75 million, will require lower cash outflows for interest, whereas the 2023 Notes have a maximum interest payment commitment of $2.9 billion through their maturity dates. This substantial difference underscores that the cost of debt service—especially over the long term—will be considerably influenced by the higher coupon rates of the 2023 Notes.\n\n3. Maturity Profiles and Financial Planning – The staggered maturities (with near-term maturities in 2025 and 2026 for the respective notes) provide a roadmap for refinancing or retiring the debt. However, with the longer-dated 2023 Notes extending out to 2053 under higher interest rates, there is an inherent pressure on long-term financial planning, as these obligations will continue to contribute a higher periodic interest expense over decades.\n\nIn summary, while the lower-rate 2020 Notes help keep near-term interest costs manageable, the higher-rate 2023 Notes will likely drive up Intuit’s future interest expense, impacting both cash flows and capital allocation strategies over the long term."

      "ground_truth": "The presence of a dedicated Lead Independent Director, as seen with Michael Dornemann, generally carries several important implications for board oversight and investor confidence. First, the role emphasizes board independence. A Lead Independent Director can act as a counterbalance to the CEO and management, ensuring that board discussions and decisions are not overly influenced by executive interests. This improves the quality of oversight by fostering a more rigorous, unbiased review of the company’s strategy, performance, and risk management. Secondly, it signals a commitment to strong governance practices. Investors often interpret the appointment of a Lead Independent Director as a proactive measure to safeguard the interests of shareholders, providing reassurance that there are checks and balances in place to mitigate potential conflicts of interest. This can enhance overall investor confidence in the company’s management and its long-term value creation strategies. Additionally, from a risk perspective, a board with a robust independent leadership structure is better equipped to address emerging challenges and ensure transparency in financial reporting and capital allocation decisions. In summary, having a dedicated Lead Independent Director like Michael Dornemann not only strengthens board oversight but also bolsters the credibility and integrity of the company’s governance practices, thereby potentially increasing investor trust in the company."

      "ground_truth": "Based on the provided reference, there are several key risks associated with the possibility of revenue reversal:\n\n1. Judgment Uncertainty in Estimations: Western Digital uses significant judgment in estimating variable consideration. These estimates are based on historical pricing, current pricing trends, channel-specific factors (like reseller inventory levels) and OEM purchase volumes. Any misestimation can lead to recording revenue that might later need to be reversed.\n\n2. Fluctuations in OEM Purchase Volumes: The methodology for OEM sales is based on the volume of purchases. If OEM volumes experience significant fluctuations (for example, a sudden drop in volume), then the originally recognized revenue (with estimated incentive considerations based on higher expected volumes) might be overstated. A significant deviation from expected volumes increases the risk of having to reverse a portion of the recognized revenue if the incentive levels are not met.\n\n3. Variability in Reseller Inventory Levels: For reseller transactions, the methodology considers current and historical pricing as well as inventory levels. A rapid change in inventory—such as higher than anticipated build-up or a quick clearance—could undermine the assumptions used in estimating variable consideration. If actual inventory movements deviate significantly from expectations, the variable consideration estimated at the time of revenue recognition could be inaccurate, increasing the likelihood of revenue reversal.\n\n4. Dependence on the Expected Value Method: The company uses the expected value method for estimating variable consideration across many contracts. While this method is effective in pooling similar contracts, large-scale anomalies or variances in specific contracts (caused by unique market or channel conditions) could lead to adjustments that require revenue reversal when previously recognized revenue does not hold against actual outcomes.\n\nOverall, the key risks tied to revenue reversal involve the sensitivity of the revenue estimates to the accuracy of the underlying assumptions on OEM volumes and reseller inventory conditions. A deviation in these key factors can lead not only to significant revenue reversals but also to volatility in reported earnings."

        "Schwab is subject to claims and lawsuits in the ordinary course of business, including arbitrations, class actions and other litigation, some of which include claims for substantial or unspecified damages. The Company is also the subject of inquiries, investigations, and proceedings by regulatory and other governmental agencies.\n\nPredicting the outcome of a litigation or regulatory matter is inherently difficult, requiring significant judgment and evaluation of various factors, including the procedural status of the matter and any recent developments; prior experience and the experience of others in similar cases; available defenses, including potential opportunities to dispose of a case on the merits or procedural grounds before trial (e.g., motions to dismiss or for summary judgment); the progress of fact discovery; the opinions of counsel and experts regarding potential damages; and potential opportunities for settlement and the status of any settlement discussions. It may not be reasonably possible to estimate a range of potential liability until the matter is closer to resolution – pending, for example, further proceedings, the outcome of key motions or appeals, or discussions among the parties. Numerous issues may have to be developed, such as discovery of important factual matters and determination of threshold legal issues, which may include novel or unsettled questions of law. Reserves are established or adjusted or further disclosure and estimates of potential loss are provided as the matter progresses and more information becomes available.\n\nSchwab believes it has strong defenses in all significant matters currently pending and is contesting liability and any damages claimed. Nevertheless, some of these matters may result in adverse judgments or awards, including penalties, injunctions or other relief, and the Company may also determine to settle a matter because of the uncertainty and risks of litigation. Described below are matters in which there is a reasonable possibility that a material loss could be incurred or where the matter may otherwise be of significant interest to stockholders. Unless otherwise noted, the Company is unable to provide a reasonable estimate of any potential liability given the stage of proceedings in the matter. With respect to all other pending matters, based on current information and consultation with counsel, it does not appear reasonably possible that the outcome of any such matter would be material to the financial condition, operating results, or cash flows of the Company.\n\nCorrente Antitrust Litigation: On June 6, 2022, CSC was sued in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas on behalf of a putative class of customers who purchased or sold securities through CS&Co or TD Ameritrade, Inc. from October 26, 2020 to the present. The lawsuit alleges that CSC’s acquisition of TD Ameritrade violated Section 7 of the Clayton Act because it has resulted in an anticompetitive market for the execution of retail customer orders. Plaintiffs seek unspecified damages, as well as injunctive and other relief. A motion by the Company to dismiss the lawsuit was denied by the court on February 24, 2023, and discovery is proceeding.\n\nCrago Order Routing Litigation: On July 13, 2016, a securities class action lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California on behalf of a putative class of customers executing equity orders through CS&Co. The lawsuit names CS&Co and CSC as defendants and alleges that an agreement under which CS&Co routed orders to UBS Securities LLC between July 13, 2011 and December 31, 2014 violated CS&Co’s duty to seek best execution. Plaintiffs seek unspecified damages, interest, injunctive and equitable relief, and attorneys’ fees and costs. After a first amended complaint was dismissed with leave to amend, plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint on August 14, 2017. Defendants again moved to dismiss, and in a decision issued December 5, 2017, the District Court denied the motion. Plaintiffs filed a motion for class certification on April 30, 2021, and in a decision on October 27, 2021, the court denied the motion and held that certification of a class action is inappropriate. Plaintiffs sought review of the order denying class certification by the U.S. Court of Appeals, 9th Circuit, which was denied. On February 2, 2023, the District Court denied a renewed motion by plaintiffs for class certification and ruled that any claims plaintiffs may pursue in their individual capacity must be brought in arbitration. The likelihood any such claims would be material to the financial condition, operating results or cash flows of the Company is remote.\n\nFord Order Routing Litigation: On September 15, 2014, TDA Holding, TD Ameritrade, Inc. and its former CEO, Frederick J. Tomczyk, were sued in the U.S. District Court for the District of Nebraska on behalf of a putative class of TD Ameritrade, Inc. clients alleging that defendants failed to seek best execution and made misrepresentations and omissions regarding its order routing practices. Plaintiff seeks unspecified damages and injunctive and other relief. On September 14, 2018, the District Court granted plaintiff’s motion for class certification, and defendants petitioned for an immediate appeal of the District Court’s class certification decision. On April 23, 2021, the U.S. Court of Appeals, 8th Circuit, issued a decision reversing the District Court’s certification of a class and remanding the case back to the District Court for further proceedings. Plaintiff renewed his motion for class certification, which the District Court granted on September 20, 2022. Defendants are appealing the District Court’s ruling before the U.S. Court of Appeals, 8th Circuit."

The Company’s approach includes establishing and adjusting reserves (or accruals) as cases progress and as more information becomes available. Although Schwab details the nature of each litigation (for instance, the Corrente, Crago Order Routing, and Ford Order Routing lawsuits) and emphasizes that it is actively contesting liability on significant matters, it clearly states that it is not possible – at this stage – to accurately estimate potential losses until further developments occur such as the resolution of critical motions or additional discovery insights.\n\nIn terms of capital allocation and financial robustness, this accounting treatment indicates that Schwab is taking a conservative and measured approach. By disclosing these uncertainties and building in contingencies via reserves, Schwab shows that it is aware of these potential risks and is managing them appropriately within its financial framework. The fact that the Company asserts these litigation issues are not expected to be material to its overall financial condition, operating results, or cash flows further reinforces the view that its capital allocation strategy is robust. It is maintaining the disciplined practice of monitoring and updating reserves as legal matters evolve, which reflects strong risk management and financial foresight, thereby preserving capital against uncertain liabilities while continuing to support strategic investments."

        "Regions and its subsidiaries are routinely subject to actual or threatened legal proceedings, including litigation and regulatory matters, arising in the ordinary course of business. Litigation matters range from individual actions involving a single plaintiff to class action lawsuits and can involve claims for substantial or indeterminate alleged damages or for injunctive or other relief. Regulatory investigations and enforcement matters may involve formal or informal proceedings and other inquiries initiated by various governmental agencies, law enforcement authorities, and self-regulatory organizations, and can result in fines, penalties, restitution, changes to Regions’ business practices, and other related costs, including reputational damage. At any given time, these legal proceedings are at varying stages of adjudication, arbitration, or investigation, and may relate to a variety of topics, including common law tort and contract claims, as well as statutory consumer protection-related claims, among others.\nAssessment of exposure that could result from legal proceedings is complex because these proceedings often involve inherently unpredictable factors, including, but not limited to, the following: whether the proceeding is in early stages; whether damages or the amount of potential fines, penalties, and restitution are unspecified, unsupported, or uncertain; whether there is a potential for punitive or other pecuniary damages; whether the matter involves legal uncertainties, including novel issues of law; whether the matter involves multiple parties and/or jurisdictions; whether discovery or other investigation has begun or is not complete; whether material facts may be disputed or unsubstantiated; whether meaningful settlement discussions have commenced; and whether the matter involves class allegations. As a result of these complexities, Regions may be unable to develop an estimate or range of loss.\nRegions evaluates legal proceedings based on information currently available, including advice of counsel. Regions establishes accruals for those matters when a loss is considered probable and the related amount is reasonably estimable. Additionally, when it is practicable and reasonably possible that it may experience losses in excess of established accruals, Regions estimates possible loss contingencies. Regions currently estimates that the aggregate amount of reasonably possible losses that it may experience, in excess of what has been accrued, is immaterial. While the final outcomes of legal proceedings are inherently unpredictable, management is currently of the opinion that the outcomes of pending and threatened matters will not have a material effect on Regions’ business, consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows as a whole.\nAs available information changes, the matters for which Regions is able to estimate, as well as the estimates themselves, will be adjusted accordingly. Regions’ estimates are subject to significant judgment and uncertainties, and the matters underlying the estimates will change from time to time. In the event of unexpected future developments, it is possible that an adverse outcome in any such matter could be material to Regions’ business, consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows as a whole for any particular reporting period of occurrence.\nSome of Regions’ exposure with respect to loss contingencies may be offset by applicable insurance coverage. However, in determining the amounts of any accruals or estimates of possible loss contingencies, Regions does not take into account the availability of insurance coverage. To the extent that Regions has an insurance recovery, the proceeds are recorded in the period the recovery is received."

Key risk management approaches include:\n\n1. Establishing accruals: When a loss is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated, Regions accrues the expense in its financial statements. This practice helps to ensure that the potential financial impact of legal proceedings is recognized in the period in which the loss is reasonably estimable.\n\n2. Estimating loss contingencies: For legal matters where estimated losses might exceed accrued amounts, Regions estimates additional possible loss contingencies when practicable. These estimates are adjusted as new information becomes available.\n\n3. Reliance on legal counsel: Risk evaluation is carried out using all available information, including the advice of legal counsel. This guidance helps in the assessment of whether to recognize a loss and the magnitude of the accrual or contingency.\n\n4. Monitoring and updating estimates: The company continuously revises its estimates for loss contingencies as circumstances change, recognizing the uncertainties inherent in the legal process. This process allows them to adapt to new developments in ongoing litigation or regulatory investigations.\n\n5. Insurance coverage: Although the availability of insurance is not directly factored into the loss accrual process, Regions does note that some legal exposures may be partially or fully offset by insurance recoveries when claims are settled and recovery proceeds are received.\n\nThese strategies collectively help Regions mitigate the financial risk associated with high-impact legal proceedings such as class action lawsuits and regulatory investigations by ensuring that potential losses are accounted for and monitored throughout the progression of any legal matter."

      "ground_truth": "The increase in total liabilities—from approximately $526.7 million in 2022 to $722.1 million in 2023 (an increase of about $195.4 million or roughly 37%)—was driven largely by a substantial rise in the \"payables to broker-dealers, clearing organizations and customers,\" which jumped from about $304.0 million in 2022 to $537.4 million in 2023. This item’s significant growth suggests that the company experienced increased volume or extended credit terms related to its core market operations. Other liability components saw smaller changes: accrued employee compensation increased modestly, while income and other tax liabilities and accounts payable/accrued expenses actually declined, and operating lease liabilities decreased slightly. \n\nIn contrast, stockholders’ equity increased from approximately $1,081.1 million in 2022 to $1,293.0 million in 2023, representing a growth of about $211.9 million or 19.6%. This rise in equity is primarily attributable to improvements in retained earnings, signaling enhanced profitability and value creation, partially offset by changes such as the reduction in treasury stock adjustments and shifts in accumulated other comprehensive loss. \n\nIn summary, while both liabilities and equity increased over the period, liabilities grew at a more accelerated rate—driven by operational factors related to broker-dealer obligations—compared to the more moderate increase in stockholders’ equity, highlighting a greater reliance on liabilities to support the company’s asset expansion and operations during this period."

        "Our electric generation, transmission, and distribution and natural gas distribution and storage operations must comply with a variety of statutes and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and human health and safety, including permitting programs implemented by federal, state, and local authorities. Such environmental laws address air emissions; discharges to water bodies; the storage, handling and disposal of hazardous substances and waste materials; siting and land use requirements; and potential ecological impacts. Complex and lengthy processes are required to obtain and renew approvals, permits, and licenses for new, existing, or modified energy-related facilities. Additionally, the use and handling of various chemicals or hazardous materials require release prevention plans and emergency response procedures. We employ dedicated personnel knowledgeable in environmental matters to oversee our business activities’ compliance with requirements of environmental laws.\nEnvironmental regulations have a significant impact on the electric utility industry and compliance with these regulations could be costly for Ameren Missouri, which operates coal-fired power plants. Regulations under the Clean Air Act that apply to the electric utility industry include the NSPS, the CSAPR, the MATS, and the National Ambient Air Quality Standards, which are subject to periodic review for certain pollutants. Collectively, these regulations cover a variety of pollutants, such as SO2, particulate matter, NOx, mercury, toxic metals and acid gases, and CO2 emissions. Regulations implementing the Clean Water Act govern both intake and discharges of water, as well as evaluation of the ecological and biological impact of those operations, and could require modifications to water intake structures or more stringent limitations on wastewater discharges. Depending upon the scope of modifications ultimately required by state regulators, capital expenditures associated with these modifications could be significant. The management and disposal of coal ash is regulated under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and the CCR Rule, which require the closure of surface impoundments at Ameren Missouri’s coal-fired energy centers. The individual or combined effects of compliance with existing and new environmental regulations could result in significant capital expenditures, increased operating costs, or the closure or alteration of operations at some of Ameren Missouri’s energy centers. Ameren and Ameren Missouri expect that such compliance costs would be recoverable through rates, subject to MoPSC prudence review, but the timing of costs and their recovery could be subject to regulatory lag.\nAdditionally, Ameren Missouri’s wind generation facilities may be subject to operating restrictions to limit the impact on protected species. Since 2021, Ameren Missouri’s High Prairie Renewable Energy Center curtailed nighttime operations from April through October to limit impacts on protected species during the critical biological season. The extent and duration of future curtailments are unknown at this time as assessment of mitigation technologies is ongoing. Ameren Missouri does not anticipate these operating curtailments will have a material impact on its results of operations, financial position, or liquidity.\nAmeren and Ameren Missouri estimate that they will need to make capital expenditures of $90 million to $120 million from 2024 through 2028 in order to comply with existing environmental regulations. Additional capital expenditures for environmental controls beyond 2028 could be required. This estimate of capital expenditures includes surface impoundment closure and corrective action measures required by the CCR Rule and modifications to cooling water intake structures at existing power plants under Clean Water Act rules, all of which are discussed below. In addition to planned retirements of coal-fired energy centers as set forth in the 2023 IRP filed with the MoPSC in September 2023 and as noted below with respect to the NSR and Clean Air Act litigation and Illinois emissions standards, Ameren Missouri’s current plan for compliance with existing air emission regulations includes burning low-sulfur coal and installing new or optimizing existing air pollution control equipment. The actual amount of capital expenditures required to comply with existing environmental regulations may vary substantially from the above estimates because of uncertainty as to future permitting requirements by state regulators and the EPA, revisions to regulatory obligations, and varying cost of potential compliance strategies, among other things.\nThe following sections describe the more significant environmental statutes and regulations and environmental enforcement and remediation matters that affect or could affect our operations. The EPA periodically amends and revises its regulations and proposes amendments to regulations and guidelines, which could ultimately result in the revision of all or part of such regulations.Clean Air Act\nFederal and state laws, including the CSAPR, regulate emissions of SO2 and NOx through the reduction of emissions at their source and the use and retirement of emission allowances. In April 2022, the EPA proposed plans for additional NOx emission reductions from power plants in Missouri, Illinois, and other states through revisions to the CSAPR. In January 2023, the EPA issued its final disapproval of Missouri’s proposed state implementation plan for addressing the transport of ozone under the Good Neighbor Plan of the Clean Air Act. The disapproval of the state plan allows the EPA to implement revisions to the CSAPR through a federal implementation plan. In March 2023, the EPA announced federal implementation plan requirements, which were subsequently published to the Federal Register in June 2023, reducing the amount of NOx allowances available for state budgets and imposing NOx emission limits on electric generating units for Missouri, Illinois, and other states under the Good Neighbor Plan of the Clean Air Act. In April 2023, the Missouri Attorney General and Ameren Missouri separately filed lawsuits in the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit challenging the EPA’s disapproval of the Missouri state plan and sought a stay of the EPA’s disapproval of the Missouri state plan. The United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit in May 2023 granted those stay motions thereby preventing the EPA from imposing the federal implementation plan until the court of appeals issues a ruling. In December 2023, the United States Supreme Court agreed to hear challenges to the Good Neighbor Plan and scheduled oral argument for February 2024, with a decision expected by June 2024. Ameren Missouri complies with the current CSAPR requirements by minimizing emissions through the use of low-sulfur coal, operation of two scrubbers at its Sioux Energy Center, and optimization of existing NOx air pollution control equipment. Reducing the amount of state budget NOx allowances for compliance with NOx emission limits could result in additional controls being required on Ameren Missouri’s generating units and/or the reduction of operations. Any additional costs for compliance are expected to be recovered from customers, subject to MoPSC prudence review, through the FAC or higher base rates.\nCO2 Emissions Standards\nIn June 2022, the United States Supreme Court issued its decision in West Virginia v. EPA, clarifying that there are limits on how the EPA may regulate greenhouse gases absent further direction from the United States Congress. The court concluded that the EPA’s proposed rules were designed to shift generation from fossil-fuel-fired power plants to renewable energy facilities, which was improper absent specific congressional authorization. In May 2023, the EPA issued a new proposed rule that would set CO2 emission standards for new and existing fossil-fuel-fired power plants based on the adoption of carbon capture technology, natural gas co-firing, and co-firing hydrogen fuel to reduce emissions. If the proposed rule were adopted, the affected fossil-fuel-fired power plants would be required to comply with the rule through a phased-in approach or retire. Capacity restrictions for coal-fired units could apply as early as 2030. Larger natural gas-fired power plants would be required to co-fire with hydrogen by 2032, with additional requirements by 2038. The EPA expects to issue a final rule in 2024. Legal challenges to the final rule, if adopted as proposed, are expected. Ameren and Ameren Missouri cannot predict the results of any such challenges or potential impacts of any such regulations on their results of operations, financial position, and liquidity until final regulations are adopted and the merits of such legal challenges are determined.\nNSR and Clean Air Act Litigation\nIn January 2011, the United States Department of Justice, on behalf of the EPA, filed a complaint against Ameren Missouri in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri alleging that projects performed in 2007 and 2010 at the coal-fired Rush Island Energy Center violated provisions of the Clean Air Act and Missouri law. In January 2017, the district court issued a liability ruling against Ameren Missouri and, in September 2019, entered a remedy order that required Ameren Missouri to install a flue gas desulfurization system at the Rush Island Energy Center and a dry sorbent injection system at the Labadie Energy Center. Following an appeal from Ameren Missouri, in August 2021, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit affirmed the liability ruling and the district court’s remedy order as it related to the installation of a flue gas desulfurization system at the Rush Island Energy Center, but reversed the order as it related to the installation of a dry sorbent injection system at the Labadie Energy Center. In September 2023, the district court granted Ameren Missouri’s request to modify the remedy order to allow the retirement of the Rush Island Energy Center in advance of its previously expected useful life in lieu of installing a flue gas desulfurization system. In its amended remedy order, the district court established an October 15, 2024 retirement date and, in the interim, authorized Ameren Missouri to operate the energy center as directed by the MISO. The United States Department of Justice is seeking an order from the district court providing for additional mitigation relief. Ameren Missouri could be required to implement mitigation relief measures, the costs of which could be material and which Ameren Missouri would not expect to recover. Ameren Missouri is challenging such mitigation claims, noting that the scope of any such potential additional mitigation relief should be limited by the August 2021 court of appeals decision and offset by emission reductions resulting from the accelerated retirement of the Rush Island Energy Center.\nThe MISO designated the energy center as a system support resource in 2022 and concluded that certain reliability mitigation measures, including transmission upgrades, should occur before the energy center is retired. The Rush Island Energy Center began operating as a system support resource on September 1, 2022. In 2023, the MISO extended the system support resource designation through August 2024, and in September 2023, an agreement between Ameren Missouri and the MISO was approved by the FERC that results in the Rush Island Energy Center only operating during peak demand times and emergencies. The system support resource designation and the related agreement are subject to annual renewal and revision. Construction activities are underway for the transmission upgrades approved by the MISO, with the majority of the upgrades expected to be completed in the fall of 2024. Ameren Missouri expects to complete the last of the upgrades by mid-2025. In addition, in August 2023, the FERC approved a settlement agreement for Ameren Missouri’s request for recovery of non-energy costs under the related MISO tariff between Ameren Missouri and certain intervenors, which provided for recovery of substantially all of Ameren Missouri’s requested non-energy costs through August 2023. In October 2023, Ameren Missouri received FERC approval for the recovery of non-energy costs under the related MISO tariff from September 2023 to August 2024. Revenues and costs under the MISO tariff are included in the FAC. Related to this matter, in February 2022, the MoPSC issued an order directing the MoPSC staff to review the planned accelerated retirement of the Rush Island Energy Center. See Note 2 – Rate and Regulatory Matters for additional information.\nIn connection with the accelerated retirement of the Rush Island Energy Center, Ameren Missouri is seeking approval from the MoPSC to finance the costs associated with the retirement, including the remaining unrecovered net plant balance associated with the facility, through the issuance of securitized utility tariff bonds pursuant to Missouri’s securitization statute. See Note 2 – Rate and Regulatory Matters for additional information. As of December 31, 2023, the Rush Island Energy Center had a net plant balance of $530 million included in plant to be abandoned, net, within “Property, Plant, and Equipment, Net”. See Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for additional information regarding plant to be abandoned, net.\nAmeren Missouri is unable to predict the ultimate resolution of this matter; however, such resolution could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial position, and liquidity of Ameren and Ameren Missouri.\nClean Water Act\nAmong other items, the Clean Water Act requires power plant operators to evaluate cooling water intake structures and identify measures for reducing the number of aquatic organisms impinged on a power plant’s cooling water intake screens or entrained through the plant’s cooling water system. All of Ameren Missouri’s coal-fired and nuclear energy centers are subject to this cooling water intake structures rule. Requirements of the rule are implemented by state regulators through the permit renewal process of each power plant’s water discharge permit. Permits for Ameren Missouri’s coal-fired and nuclear energy centers have been issued or are in the process of renewal.\nIn 2015, the EPA issued a rule to revise the effluent limitation guidelines applicable to steam electric generating units. These guidelines established national standards for water discharges, prohibit effluent discharges of certain waste streams, and impose more stringent limitations on certain water discharges from power plants by 2025. To comply with these guidelines, Ameren Missouri installed dry ash handling systems and wastewater treatment facilities at its coal-fired energy centers.\nCCR Management\nThe EPA’s CCR Rule establishes requirements for the management and disposal of CCR from coal-fired power plants and has resulted in the closure of surface impoundments at Ameren Missouri’s energy centers, with closures of surface impoundments in process at its Sioux Energy Center and retired Meramec Energy Center. Ameren Missouri plans to substantially complete the closures of remaining surface impoundments by the end of 2026. Ameren Missouri’s CCR management compliance plan includes installation of groundwater monitoring equipment and groundwater treatment facilities. Ameren and Ameren Missouri have AROs of $40 million recorded on their respective balance sheets as of December 31, 2023, associated with CCR storage facilities.\nRemediation\nThe Ameren Companies are involved in a number of remediation actions to clean up sites impacted by the use or disposal of materials containing hazardous substances. Federal and state laws can require responsible parties to fund remediation regardless of their degree of fault, the legality of original disposal, or the ownership of a disposal site.\nAs of December 31, 2023, Ameren Illinois has remediated the majority of the 44 former MGP sites in Illinois with an estimated remaining obligation primarily related to three of these former MGP sites at $51 million to $96 million. Ameren and Ameren Illinois recorded a liability of $51 million to represent the estimated minimum obligation for these sites, as no other amount within the range was a better estimate. Ameren cannot estimate the completion date of the estimated remaining obligation due to site accessibility, among other things. The scope of the remediation activities at these former MGP sites may increase as remediation efforts continue. Considerable uncertainty remains in these estimates because many site-specific factors can influence the actual costs, including unanticipated underground structures, the degree to which groundwater is encountered, regulatory changes, local ordinances, and site accessibility. The actual costs and timing of completion may vary substantially from these estimates.\nThe ICC allows Ameren Illinois to recover MGP remediation and related litigation costs from its electric and natural gas utility customers through environmental cost riders that are subject to annual prudence reviews by the ICC. Our operations or those of our predecessor companies involve the use of, disposal of, and, in appropriate circumstances, the cleanup of substances regulated under environmental laws. We are unable to determine whether such historical practices will result in future environmental commitments, including additional or more stringent cleanup standards, or will affect our results of operations, financial position, or liquidity.\nIllinois Emission Standards\nThe CEJA established emission standards that became effective in September 2021. Ameren Missouri's natural gas-fired energy centers in Illinois are subject to annual limits on emissions, including CO2 and NOx. Further reductions to emissions limits will become effective between 2030 and 2040, resulting in the closure of the Venice Energy Center by the end of 2029. The reductions could also limit the operations of Ameren Missouri's four other natural gas-fired energy centers located in the state of Illinois, and will result in their closure by 2040. These energy centers are utilized to support peak loads. Subject to conditions in the CEJA, these energy centers may be allowed to exceed the emissions limits in order to maintain reliability of electric utility service. Ameren Missouri filed its 2023 IRP with the MoPSC in September 2023 to reflect, among other things, the updated scheduled retirement dates of the natural gas-fired energy centers located in the state of Illinois."

      "ground_truth": "Ameren Corporation is managing its environmental remediation and related liabilities through a series of measures designed to both control costs and lessen their potential negative financial impact. First, the company’s strategy involves planning and executing capital projects—such as the closure of CCR (coal combustion residual) surface impoundments with an expected substantial completion by the end of 2026, as well as the installation of groundwater monitoring and treatment facilities—to manage and contain ongoing CCR management costs. In addition, for its former Manufactured Gas Plant (MGP) sites, where a minimum liability of approximately $51 million has already been recorded, Ameren is actively remediating the majority of the affected sites. The remediation costs are structured to be recoverable through environmental cost riders in its electric and natural gas tariffs. These cost recovery measures are subject to regulatory prudence reviews by bodies like the Illinois Commerce Commission (ICC) and the Missouri Public Service Commission (MoPSC), which helps to shift the financial burden away from the company’s balance sheet over time. Furthermore, the company employs dedicated environmental personnel to ensure compliance with evolving environmental regulations, which aids in anticipating and managing additional remediation and mitigation costs. Lastly, in litigation contexts—such as those related to Clean Air Act enforcement—Ameren has taken steps (for example, seeking modifications of remedy orders and challenging additional mitigation claims) to limit non-recoverable expenses. Together, these measures help the company control environmental remediation expenses and mitigate their impact on overall financial health."

      "ground_truth": "The information provided about CFO Karen L. Parkhill and Global Controller Stephanie Liebman gives clear insight into HP Inc.’s financial leadership and overall governance capabilities. Both executives bring extensive experience in financial management and operations from previous high-profile roles at major companies—Parkhill from financial institutions and healthcare/technology companies, and Liebman with a longstanding history at HP complemented by experience at other IT and business service companies. This depth and breadth of expertise suggest that HP is well positioned to maintain, if not improve, the transparency and accuracy of its financial reporting. A strong financial oversight team can enforce robust internal controls, enhance the quality of financial disclosures, and maintain adherence to stringent regulatory reporting standards.\n\nHigh-quality, transparent reporting typically reduces perceived risk among investors. It builds trust in the accuracy of the company’s earnings and cash flow assessments. Consequently, these attributes can be viewed favorably in financial markets and may lower the company's risk premium, which in turn can lead to higher valuation multiples. In essence, if the market perceives HP Inc. as having a lower risk profile and believes in its superior corporate governance, investors might assign a premium to its stock relative to peers. While no specific numerical multiples can be calculated from the provided qualitative data, the expertise of these leaders implies that HP Inc. is geared towards delivering more reliable financial performance, potentially justifying higher price-to-earnings or enterprise value multiples in the broader market."

        "Our mission is to entertain and connect generations of fans through the wonder of storytelling and exhilaration of play. We are \"Creating Magic Through Play\". Our strategic plan, which we refer to as our Blueprint or Blueprint 2.0, supports our mission by bringing compelling and expansive brand experiences to consumers and audiences around the world. Using this approach, our brands are transformed as story-led and play-led consumer franchises brought to life through games, play and experiences and offered across a multitude of platforms and media. Our commitment to disciplined, strategic investments, differentiates Hasbro as a purpose-driven business with diversified capabilities focused on driving long-term, sustainable and profitable growth and enhancing shareholder value.\nWe are focused on a number of key areas.\nInnovative Play\n•Build innovative toys and games that create memorable, social and collectible experiences of play and entertainment in our key focus categories: games (board games, trading cards, role playing); preschool; action brands; creativity; outdoor; and dolls.\nExpanding Brands\n•Focus on a franchise-first approach to deliver the magic of our brands through licensing, digital games and entertainment.\n•Focus on fewer, bigger, more profitable brands and driving market share in our key focus categories.\n•Entertainment investments focused on Hasbro IP aligned with our strategic plan, including merchandise and digital engagement opportunities with a focus on franchise brands.\nAnalytics and Insights\n•Develop our insights and analytics capabilities, which are heavily focused on putting consumers at the center of everything we do, as we build multi-generational brands.\nDirect to Consumer\n•Invest in our Hasbro direct-to-consumer business and build direct relationships with fans through ecommerce, social, digital games and services.\nDigital Gaming\n•Continue to cultivate our digital gaming business, through AAA games, games as a service and licensing relationships that activate our brands. Licensing\n•Scale licensing of our brands through a growing portfolio of partners from theme park operators to toy companies, for consumers to experience our brands and drive communities of friendship and fandom around them.\nOperational Excellence\n•Execute operational savings initiatives, including supply chain transformation, to improve operating results and reinvest in our business.\nPeople\n•Invest in and empower our people at all levels of our organization and continue to foster a diverse and inclusive culture that drives accountability and focuses on profitability.\nHasbro's purpose of creating joy and community for all people around the world, one game, one toy, one story at a time starts with consumers and our fans, who represent multigenerational audiences that sit at the center of our strategy. Understanding our fans, expanding our fan base and delivering for them is the key driver behind our evolution as a brand-driven toy and game company. The development and execution of our brands are informed by our brand insights platform, a proprietary consumer insights and data analytics system which helps us understand the behavior of our consumers. We have learned that consumers will travel with a brand that they love across multiple forms and formats, including our core historical strength of toys and games and licensed consumer products, as well as digital gaming and story-led entertainment and experiences.\nThe value of Hasbro is fully activated when we can take a brand across multiple elements of Blueprint 2.0 including consumer products such as digital gaming; toys, games and licensed products; entertainment and experiences; and our Hasbro Direct business. The ability to build a brand and leverage in-house capabilities to create multiple categories of engagement with consumers and fans is an advantage for Hasbro and helps to optimize our economics.\nBelow is a summary of key areas of focus for activating our brands.\n•Toys and Games. We market and sell toys and games based on our owned and controlled brands globally at retail stores, through ecommerce platforms and through our fan-based direct-to-consumer platforms Hasbro PULSE and SECRET LAIR. Additionally, through license agreements with third parties, we develop and sell products based on popular third-party brands through these channels. Our toys and games include action figures, arts and crafts and creative play products, dolls, play sets, preschool toys, plush products, sports action blasters and accessories, vehicles and toy-related specialty products, games and many other consumer products which represent an array of internationally recognizable brands that capture the imagination of our consumers worldwide.\nWithin toys and games, as a leading producer of new and innovative gaming brands and play experiences, our gaming business continues to transform game play. To successfully execute our gaming strategy, we consider brands which capitalize on existing trends while evolving our approach using consumer insights and data analytics, technology advancements and offering game-play experiences addressed to consumer demand for face-to-face, trading card and digital game experiences played as board, off-the-board, digital, card, electronic, trading card and role-playing games. Our goal is to create innovative toys and games that create memorable and magical moments that last a lifetime.\nOur subsidiary, Wizards of the Coast (“Wizards”), is a critical part of our gaming business, driving innovation and growth through its popular role-playing and fantasy card-collecting games such as MAGIC: THE GATHERING, Hasbro's first billion-dollar brand which benefited from multiple tentpole set releases exceeding $100.0 million per set during 2023, and DUNGEONS & DRAGONS. Our iconic game brands include long-time favorites such as MONOPOLY, JENGA, CONNECT 4, THE GAME OF LIFE, SCRABBLE, CLUE and TRIVIAL PURSUIT, as well as many other well-known game brands.\n•Licensed Consumer Products. As a complement to our toy and game business, we promote our brands through the out-licensing of our intellectual properties to third parties for promotional and merchandising uses in a wide range of consumer products. These include apparel, publishing, home goods and electronics, or in certain situations, toy products where the out-licensing of brands is more effective and profitable than developing and marketing the products ourselves. A recent example of this includes the return of our LITTLEST PET SHOP brand through our partnership with Basic Fun!, a global marketer of toys and consumer products. Together we relaunched LITTLEST PET SHOP through a Roblox\nexperience in December 2023 and expect a refreshed LITTLEST PET SHOP product lineup in the first half of 2024 featuring new characters, collectables, and play-sets. We also out-license our brands for uses in theme park attractions and other forms of location-based entertainment. In cases where we license our intellectual property to a third party, we enter into contracts with licensees that pay us either a sales-based or usage-based royalty, or a combination of both, for use of the brands, and, in some cases, the license arrangements are subject to minimum guaranteed amounts or fixed fees, over the term of the license.\n•Digital Gaming. Important to our success is the continued growth and development of our digital gaming business, including development of AAA games, games as a service and licensed games. Spanning action role-playing games for web-based play, PC and gaming consoles, to Hasbro branded mobile application-based games, our digital gaming business helps to unlock the full value of our brands and achieve our mission of storytelling and bringing our brands to life. Recent examples include the 2023 release of Baldur's Gate 3, the DUNGEONS & DRAGONS-based role-playing video game from our partners at Larian Studios which won six awards, including Game of the Year at the 10th annual Game Awards. In 2022, we acquired D&D Beyond, the premier digital content platform for DUNGEONS & DRAGONS. In addition, we continue to develop and enhance other digital games internally and through third parties. For example, we have developed and launched the digital version of the MAGIC: THE GATHERING card game, Magic: The Gathering Arena and its related mobile application, both of which complement the Company's direct-to-customer relationships with our new and long-time, MAGIC: THE GATHERING fan-base. We also out-license certain of our brands to other third-party digital game developers who transform Hasbro brand-based characters and other intellectual properties into digital gaming experiences such as Baldur's Gate 3. One example is the popular Monopoly Go! free-to-play mobile game, released by Scopely, Inc. during 2023 and based on the classic board game, MONOPOLY.\n•Entertainment. Reinforcing storylines associated with our owned and controlled Hasbro and Family Brands through entertainment mediums, including television, film, digital content and other programming is our primary entertainment strategy. With our cross-platform capabilities our entertainment business leverages film and television production and sales, digital content and children's programming to create compelling entertainment and drive creativity and overall awareness across brands with merchandising and licensing tie-ins.\n◦Film and Television. Our go-forward primary focus is on the development, production and co-production of content based upon Hasbro brands. Our film content is offered on all media channels, including cinema, home entertainment, broadcast and digital, including Subscription Video‑On‑Demand (\"SVOD\").\nWe partner with Paramount Pictures (“Paramount”) to produce and distribute live action and animated films, as well as television programming based on Hasbro brands. We play an active role alongside Paramount in content development, production and distribution in addition to the financing of films created through our cooperative agreements. Under this relationship we released Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves, in early 2023, and under a separate agreement entered with Paramount, we released the feature length film, Transformers: Rise of the Beasts, in the Summer of 2023.\n◦Family Brands Animation. Our family brands team develops, produces and distributes Hasbro brand-based animation content for children’s properties on a worldwide basis which results in multiple touchpoints across Blueprint 2.0. The principal brands include PEPPA PIG and MY LITTLE PONY whose content entertains children worldwide and generates revenues through licensing and merchandising programs across multiple retail categories. These brands generate revenues from Advertising Video-On-Demand (“AVOD”) through platforms such as YouTube and SVOD revenues from the sale of content to video streaming platforms. Our portfolio of preschool brand driven content also includes BABY ALIVE and PLAY-DOH and the development of new preschool programs and properties.\n•Hasbro Direct. Our Hasbro Direct business is our \"Fans Come First\" approach, intended to create direct connections with our consumers and includes the following platforms:\n◦Magic: The Gathering Arena - the free-to-play online adaptation of the MAGIC: THE GATHERING card game where players can explore the fantasy worlds of Magic: The Gathering Arena, play a variety of game formats to collect cards and test skills against friends and other players around the world, or enter in-game tournaments.\n◦SECRET LAIR - our internet-based storefront where MAGIC: THE GATHERING fans can purchase exclusive and limited versions of cards.\n◦D&D Beyond - the premier digital content platform for DUNGEONS & DRAGONS where fans can access online versions of official rule books, character sheets and catalogs, adventures, and other digital tools such as character builders and official D&D content available for purchase.\n◦Hasbro PULSE - Hasbro's ultimate fan ecommerce destination. At Hasbro Pulse our fans can find product offerings and experiences from our popular brands as well as access to views of behind-the-scenes material and insider details. In addition, Hasbro Pulse offers consumers access to product related livestreams such as fan oriented virtual conventions and product and merchandise reveals, as well as the opportunity to participate in HasLab, the Hasbro crowdfunding platform which brings limited-edition collectibles into the hands of fans.\nWith these platforms, we are expanding and enhancing our capabilities beyond the traditional ecommerce outlet to serve our consumers and activate brands across Blueprint 2.0. Connecting with fans directly makes our products more accessible in more markets and enables us to sell brands and showcase selected items, creating more brand awareness while gaining a deeper understanding of our fans and what they want and expect from Hasbro.\n\n•Other Elements of our Strategy. Other aspects of our strategy that help drive our storytelling experiences include digital content, location-based entertainment, and publishing.\n◦Digital Content. We understand the importance of digital content to drive fan engagement, including in gaming and across other media, and of integrating such content with our products. Digital media encompasses digital gaming applications and the creation of digital environments for traditional products through the use of complementary digital applications, social media and websites which extend storylines and enhance play.\n◦Location-Based Entertainment. Location-based entertainment (“LBE”) allows consumers to experience and share our brands. LBE includes licensing our brands to theme parks, water parks, hotels and resorts, family entertainment centers, retail, dining and entertainment, shows, exhibits and exhibitions such as Hasbro City, the newly-opened Hasbro-themed family entertainment center located in Paseo Interlomas, Mexico featuring thrilling theme park rides and experiences, live shows, food and beverage options and the region's first Hasbro-themed retail location. These experiences bring our brands to life and further immerse our consumers in our storytelling in a capital efficient manner.\n◦Publishing. Licensing our brands to global publishers is another way to bring our brands to consumers in a meaningful way through various publishing formats, from puzzle and trivia books to children's stories, adult novels and comics."

Specifically, the Governance Committee is tasked with reviewing and making recommendations on ESG issues such as climate, human rights, and Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DE&I) – ensuring that such performance metrics are closely monitored. The Audit Committee plays a critical role in overseeing SEC and public disclosures, which includes areas like sustainability and conflict minerals. This ensures that the company remains transparent and accountable in its external reporting. Additionally, the Compensation Committee incorporates ESG performance into executive compensation decisions, further aligning leadership incentives with the company’s strategic priorities. Collectively, these board committees help ensure that strategic decisions—ranging from ESG initiatives to the activation of Hasbro’s multi-platform brand strategy—are not only efficiently executed but also that the outcomes, such as enhanced operational performance and sustainable growth, contribute to long-term shareholder value. This governance structure facilitates appropriate risk management and reinforces a commitment to both transparency and strategic alignment, ultimately supporting the company’s mission and financial success."

In reviewing the debt table, we see that the total principal decreased from $15,886 million to $14,972 million, a reduction of $914 million. This $914 million drop is primarily due to the repayment of $914 million of fixed‐rate notes in May 2024. Additionally, favorable changes in the accounting adjustments offset part of the principal reduction. Specifically, the unamortized discount improved from ($238) million to ($212) million (a $26 million improvement) and the hedge accounting adjustments improved from ($250) million to ($126) million (a $124 million improvement). When these adjustments are added back ($26 + $124 = $150 million), the net reduction in total long‐term debt is $914 million − $150 million = $764 million. This explanation provides a clear view of both the principal changes driven by the repayment and the impact of the accounting adjustments, which together account for the overall decrease in total long‐term debt."

      "ground_truth": "The provided data outlines a comprehensive, proactive cybersecurity framework that includes a dedicated incident response process, continuous threat assessments, and regular audits with third-party experts. This framework positions the company to maintain operational resilience in several ways. First, by promptly identifying and mitigating cybersecurity incidents, the company can minimize operational disruptions, protect its critical assets, and ensure business continuity. This proactive posture reduces the likelihood of costly incidents that could otherwise impact production or distribution, thereby preserving stable cash flows.\n\nIn terms of implications for future cash flow and growth potential, there are several key points:\n1. Operational Stability: A robust incident response and threat assessment program diminishes downtime and limits disruptions, ensuring that revenue-generating activities are not adversely affected. Stable operations support predictable cash flows, which are critical for both reinvestment and debt servicing.\n2. Risk Mitigation Cost Savings: Effective cybersecurity reduces the risk of significant financial losses incurred from breaches or data loss, including potential legal costs, regulatory fines, and recovery expenses. Savings in these areas may contribute to improved margins and overall profitability.\n3. Investor and Customer Confidence: Maintaining trust through rigorous cybersecurity practices can enhance the company's reputation, thereby aiding customer retention and attracting new business. This, in turn, supports long-term growth.\n4. Strategic Capital Allocation: With reduced risk, the company may more confidently allocate capital towards growth initiatives like research and development, market expansion, or innovation in its core products. Sustained investment in growth areas can positively influence future cash flows.\n\nWhile the provided cybersecurity details do not include numerical data for a direct calculation, the qualitative assessment indicates that the strong, proactive cybersecurity framework not only serves as a defensive measure but also as a strategic enabler. It supports operational stability and could lead to more predictable cash flow and enhanced growth potential over the long term."

      "ground_truth": "Between 2024 and 2028, CSX’s payment commitments for locomotive maintenance and rebuilds are substantially higher than the commitments for other purchase obligations. For example, in 2024 the company is scheduled to pay $342 million for maintenance compared to $182 million for other purchases. This trend is even more pronounced in subsequent years – in 2026, the maintenance payment is $397 million while other commitments are only $37 million, and similar patterns occur in 2027 and 2028. Over the five‐year stretch, the total maintenance and rebuild payments add up to approximately $2,027 million versus about $426 million in other commitments. As a result, maintenance expenses are roughly 4.8 times larger than other capital commitments.\n\nThese ratios imply several key considerations for CSX’s liquidity and capital allocation:\n1. Liquidity Management: The significant and recurring maintenance outlays require CSX to ensure strong and stable liquidity. The company must account for these predetermined cash outflows to avoid any shortfall, especially since these costs are essential for preserving fleet reliability and operational safety.\n2. Capital Allocation: With nearly 80% or more of the near-term payment obligations concentrated in locomotive maintenance and rebuilds, there is less flexibility in reallocating capital to other strategic initiatives or discretionary investments. The heavy bias towards maintenance could limit the company’s capacity to invest in growth projects or technological upgrades without impacting its cash reserves.\n3. Risk Considerations: The high fixed nature of these commitments suggests that any unexpected downturn in revenue or an increase in operating costs could place pressure on free cash flow. This heavy commitment might also affect CSX’s financial flexibility and influence decisions regarding leverage and investment priorities.\n\nIn summary, the maintenance commitments dominate the near-term payment schedule, which underscores the importance of carefully managing liquidity and prioritizing capital allocation to balance operational necessities with growth opportunities."

        "In the normal course of business, we are subject to routine litigation incidental to our business. While the results of this litigation cannot be predicted with certainty, we believe that their final outcome will not, individually or in aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements taken as a whole.\nOn June 2, 2021, New York University (\"NYU\") filed a complaint for patent infringement in the United States District Court, District of Delaware against ResMed Inc., case no. 1:21-cv-00813 (JPM). The complaint alleges that the AutoSet or AutoRamp features of ResMed’s AirSense 10 AutoSet flow generators infringe one or more claims of various NYU patents, including U.S. Patent Nos. 6,988,994; 9,108,009; 9,168,344; 9,427,539; 9,533,115; 9,867,955; and 10,384,024. According to the complaint, the NYU patents are directed to systems and methods for diagnosis and treating sleeping disorders during different sleep states. The complaint seeks monetary damages and attorneys’ fees. We answered the complaint on September 30, 2021 and filed a motion to dismiss the complaint on the basis that the patents are invalid because the subject matter of the patents is not patentable under the Supreme Court and Federal Circuit precedent. The motion to dismiss was granted in part and denied in part. In December 2022, the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (“PTAB”) of the Patent and Trademark Office granted our request to review the validity of the claims in the patents asserted by NYU against us, determining that there is a reasonable likelihood that we will prevail. In December 2023, the PTAB issued written decisions invalidating each of the challenged claims in each of the NYU patents asserted against us. On December 28, 2023, the District Court entered an order continuing its stay of all proceedings against us pending any appeal by NYU of the invalidation of its patents by the PTAB. On January 31, 2024, NYU appealed the PTAB’s rulings to the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. The appeals are not expected to be resolved before March 2025.\nOn January 27, 2021, the International Trade Commission (\"ITC\") instituted In Re Certain UMTS and LTE Cellular Communications Modules and Products Containing the Same, Investigation No. 337-TA-1240, by complainants Philips RS North America, LLC and Koninklijke Philips N.V. (collectively “Philips”) against Quectel Wireless Solutions Co., Ltd; Thales DIS AIS USA, LLC, Thales DIS AIS Deutschland GmbH; Telit Wireless Solutions, Inc., Telit Communications PLC, CalAmp. Corp., Xirgo Technologies, LLC, and Laird Connectivity, Inc. (collectively “respondents”). In the ITC investigation, Philips seeks an order excluding communications modules, and products that contain them, from importation into the United States based on alleged infringement of 3G and 4G standard essential patents held by Philips. On October 6-14, 2021, the administrative law judge held a hearing on the merits. The administrative law judge issued an initial determination on April 1, 2022, finding no violation of any of the Philips' patents asserted in the ITC. Philips sought review by the full ITC. On July 6, 2022, the Commission affirmed the administrative law judge’s determination that there was no violation of asserted Philips' patents. The Commission terminated the ITC proceedings. Philips did not appeal the ITC’s decision. On December 17, 2020, Philips filed companion cases for patent infringement against the same defendants in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware, case nos. 1:20-cv-01707, 01708, 01709, 01710, 01711, and 01713 (CFC) seeking damages, an injunction, and a declaration from the court on the amount of a fair reasonable and non-discriminatory license rate for the standard essential patents it is asserting against the communications module defendants. The district court cases were stayed pending the resolution of the ITC proceedings. The parties have returned to the district court for further proceedings. We were not a party to the ITC investigation, and we are not a party to the district court cases, but we sell products that incorporate communications modules at issue in the district court case. The first trial in the cases by Philips against the communications module defendants was originally set for August 12, 2024. On August 5, 2024, the court issued an order vacating the trial date.\nOn June 16, 2022, Cleveland Medical Devices Inc. (\"Cleveland Medical\") filed suit for patent infringement against ResMed Inc. in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware, case no. 1:22-cv-00794. Cleveland Medical asserts that numerous ResMed connected devices, when combined with certain ResMed data platforms and/or software, including AirView and ResScan, infringe one or more of seven Cleveland Medical patents, including U.S. Patent Nos. 10,076,269; 10,426,399; 10,925,535; 11,064,937; 10,028,698; 11,202,603; and 11,234,637. We moved to dismiss the action because Cleveland Medical sued the wrong ResMed entity, and to dismiss the indirect and willful infringement allegations by Cleveland Medical. On October 2, 2023, the court granted a portion of the motion, dismissing all Cleveland Medical claims for indirect and willful infringement, and denied the rest of the motion. On March 22, 2023, ResMed Corp. filed a petition with the PTAB seeking review of the validity of U.S. Patent No. 10,076,269. On May 6, 2024, the PTAB granted the petition and instituted an Inter Partes Review proceeding against the patent. On June 21, 2024, the District Court of Delaware granted ResMed’s motion to stay the case until the PTAB issues its final written decision in the Inter Partes Review proceeding. The PTAB decision is expected by May 6, 2025.\nOn March 20, 2023, ResMed Corp. filed suit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California, case no. 23-cv-00500-TWR-JLB, seeking a declaration that it does not infringe U.S. Patent No. 11,602,284 issued to Cleveland Medical. In November 2023, the case was transferred to the Northern District of Ohio for the convenience of the parties. Cleveland Medical answered the complaint and filed a counterclaim asserting that ResMed Corp. infringes three additional Cleveland Medical patents, including U.S. Patent Nos. 11,375,921; 11,690,512; and 11,786,680. On April 9, 2024, Cleveland Medical filed a second amended answer and counterclaims accusing ResMed Corp. of infringing U.S. Patent Nos. 11,857,333 and 11,872,029. ResMed Corp. filed a petition with the PTAB for post-grant review of the validity of U.S. Patent No. 11,602,284, which the PTAB denied on June 24, 2024. On July 24, 2024, ResMed Corp. requested rehearing of the PTAB's denial of the petition for post-grant review of US Patent No. 11,602,284.\nBased on currently available information, we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of loss or range of losses, if any, arising from matters that remain open."

      "ground_truth": "Based on the provided disclosures, the favorable legal outcomes—most notably the PTAB's decision to invalidate the NYU patents—are likely to have a positive impact on investor confidence and ResMed’s competitive positioning. First, from an investor standpoint, a reduction in potential litigation risk improves the overall risk profile of the company. With the PTAB finding supporting ResMed’s arguments that the patents are invalid, investors may feel more secure that the company is less likely to incur significant future litigation losses, leading to a more stable outlook. Second, from a competitive positioning perspective, invalidation of key patents used by a competitor helps protect ResMed’s product features (like the AutoSet or AutoRamp functions) against challenges. This reinforces the company’s control over its intellectual property, maintaining the uniqueness of its offerings in the market and potentially deterring future patent disputes. Although no quantitative metrics (such as changes in stock price or valuation multiples) are provided in the disclosure, qualitatively these developments reduce uncertainty and legal exposure, which in turn may translate into a more favorable market perception and stronger competitive positioning."

In addition, we face competition from free sources of information that are available to our clients through the internet. Limited barriers to entry exist in the markets in which we do business. As a result, new competitors may emerge and existing competitors may start to provide additional or complementary services.

      "reference": [
        "Electric Utility Operating Revenues\n\nElectricity sales to residential and commercial and industrial customers are generally accomplished through requirements contracts, which provide for the delivery of as much electricity as the customer needs. These contracts represent discrete deliveries of electricity and consist of one distinct performance obligation satisfied over time, as the electricity is delivered and consumed by the customer simultaneously. For our Wisconsin residential and commercial and industrial customers and the majority of our Michigan residential and commercial and industrial customers, our performance obligation is bundled to consist of both the sale and the delivery of the electric commodity. In our Michigan service territory, a limited number of residential and commercial and industrial customers can purchase the commodity from a third party. In this case, the delivery of the electricity represents our sole performance obligation.\n\nThe transaction price of the performance obligations for residential and commercial and industrial customers is valued using the rates, charges, terms, and conditions of service included in the tariffs of our regulated electric utilities, which have been approved by state regulators. These rates often have a fixed component customer charge and a usage-based variable component charge. We recognize revenue for the fixed component customer charge monthly using a time-based output method. We recognize revenue for the usage-based variable component charge using an output method based on the quantity of electricity delivered each month. Our retail electric rates in Wisconsin include base amounts for fuel and purchased power costs, which also impact our revenues. The electric fuel rules set by the PSCW allow us to defer, for subsequent rate recovery or refund, under- or over-collections of actual fuel and purchased power costs beyond a 2% price variance from the costs included in the rates charged to customers. Our electric utilities monitor the deferral of under-collected costs to ensure that it does not cause them to earn a greater ROE than authorized by the PSCW. In contrast, the rates of our Michigan retail electric customers include recovery of fuel and purchased power costs on a one-for-one basis. In addition, the Wisconsin residential tariffs of WE and WPS include a mechanism for cost recovery or refund of uncollectible expense based on the difference between actual uncollectible write-offs and the amounts recovered in rates.\n\nWholesale customers who resell power can choose to either bundle capacity and electricity services together under one contract with a supplier or purchase capacity and electricity separately from multiple suppliers. Furthermore, wholesale customers can choose to have our utilities provide generation to match the customer's load, similar to requirements contracts, or they can purchase specified quantities of electricity and capacity. Contracts with wholesale customers that include capacity bundled with the delivery of electricity contain two performance obligations, as capacity and electricity are often transacted separately in the marketplace at the wholesale level. When recognizing revenue associated with these contracts, the transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price. Revenue is recognized as control of each individual component is transferred to the customer. Electricity is the primary product sold by our electric utilities and represents a single performance obligation satisfied over time through discrete deliveries to a customer. Revenue from electricity sales is generally recognized as units are produced and delivered to the customer within the production month. Capacity represents the reservation of an electric generating facility and conveys the ability to call on a plant to produce electricity when needed by the customer. The nature of our performance obligation as it relates to capacity is to stand ready to deliver power. This represents a single performance obligation transferred over time, which generally represents a monthly obligation. Accordingly, capacity revenue is recognized on a monthly basis.\n\nThe transaction price of the performance obligations for wholesale customers is valued using the rates, charges, terms, and conditions of service, which have been approved by the FERC. These wholesale rates include recovery of fuel and purchased power costs from customers on a one-for-one basis. For the majority of our wholesale customers, the price billed for energy and capacity is a formula-based rate. Formula-based rates initially set a customer's current year rates based on the previous year’s expenses. This is a predetermined formula derived from the utility's costs and a reasonable rate of return. Because these rates are eventually trued up to reflect actual current-year costs, they represent a form of variable consideration in certain circumstances. The variable consideration is estimated and recognized over time as wholesale customers receive and consume the capacity and electricity services. We are an active participant in the MISO Energy Markets, where we bid our generation into the Day Ahead and Real Time markets and procure electricity for our retail and wholesale customers at prices determined by the MISO Energy Markets. Purchase and sale transactions are recorded using settlement information provided by MISO. These purchase and sale transactions are accounted for on a net hourly position. Net purchases in a single hour are recorded as purchased power in cost of sales, and net sales in a single hour are recorded as resale revenues on our income statements. For resale revenues, our performance obligation is created only when electricity is sold into the MISO Energy Markets.\n\nFor all of our customers, consistent with the timing of when we recognize revenue, customer billings generally occur on a monthly basis, with payments typically due in full within 30 days.\n\nNatural Gas Utility Operating Revenues\n\nWe recognize natural gas utility operating revenues under requirements contracts with residential, commercial and industrial, and transportation customers served under the tariffs of our regulated utilities. Tariffs provide our customers with the standard terms and conditions, including rates, related to the services offered. Requirements contracts provide for the delivery of as much natural gas as the customer needs. These requirements contracts represent discrete deliveries of natural gas and constitute a single performance obligation satisfied over time. Our performance obligation is both created and satisfied with the transfer of control of natural gas upon delivery to the customer. For most of our customers, natural gas is delivered and consumed by the customer simultaneously. A performance obligation can be bundled to consist of both the sale and the delivery of the natural gas commodity. In certain of our service territories, customers can purchase the commodity from a third party. In this case, the performance obligation only includes the delivery of the natural gas to the customer.\n\nThe transaction price of the performance obligations for our natural gas customers is valued using the rates, charges, terms, and conditions of service included in the tariffs of our regulated utilities, which have been approved by state regulators. These rates often have a fixed component customer charge and a usage-based variable component charge. We recognize revenue for the fixed component customer charge monthly using a time-based output method. We recognize revenue for the usage-based variable component charge using an output method based on natural gas delivered each month.\n\nThe tariffs of our natural gas utilities include various rate mechanisms that allow them to recover or refund changes in prudently incurred costs from rate case-approved amounts. The rates for all of our natural gas utilities include one-for-one recovery mechanisms for natural gas commodity costs. Under normal circumstances, we defer any difference between actual natural gas costs incurred and costs recovered through rates as a current asset or liability. The deferred balance is returned to or recovered from customers at intervals throughout the year. However, as a result of the extreme weather in the Midwest in February 2021, the cost of gas purchased for our natural gas customers was temporarily driven significantly higher than our normal winter weather expectations, and we were not allowed to recover all of the additional costs. See Note 26, Regulatory Environment, for more information on the recovery of these high natural gas costs.\n\nIn addition, the rates of PGL and NSG, and the residential tariffs of WE, WPS, and WG, include riders or other mechanisms for cost recovery or refund of uncollectible expense based on the difference between actual uncollectible write-offs and the amounts recovered in rates. The rates of PGL and NSG include riders for cost recovery of both environmental cleanup costs and energy conservation and management program costs. Finally, through the end of 2023, PGL's rates included a rider for pass through of income tax expense changes resulting from the Tax Legislation and a cost recovery mechanism for SMP costs. Similarly, the rates of MGU include a rider to recover costs incurred to replace or modify natural gas facilities.\n\nConsistent with the timing of when we recognize revenue, customer billings generally occur on a monthly basis, with payments typically due in full within 30 days.\n\nOther Natural Gas Operating Revenues\n\nWe have other natural gas operating revenues from Bluewater, which is in our non-utility energy infrastructure segment. Bluewater has entered into long-term service agreements for natural gas storage services with WE, WPS, and WG, and also provides limited service to unaffiliated customers. We recognize revenues using a time-based output method through a monthly fixed service fee. Typical storage contract rates consist of firm storage reservation charges and firm injection and withdrawal charges. All amounts associated with the service agreements with WE, WPS, and WG have been eliminated at the consolidated level.\nOther Non-Utility Operating Revenues\n\nWind and solar generation revenues from WECI's ownership interests in renewable generation facilities continued to grow in 2023. See Note 2, Acquisitions, for more information on recent acquisitions. Most of these renewable generation facilities have offtake agreements with unaffiliated third parties for all of the energy to be produced by the facility, some of which are bundled with capacity and RECs. We consider bundled energy, capacity, and RECs within these offtake agreements to be distinct performance obligations as each are often transacted separately in the marketplace.\n\nWhen recognizing revenue associated with these contracts, the transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price. Revenue is recognized as control of each individual component is transferred to the customer. Revenue from the sale of this renewable energy is generally recognized as units are produced and delivered to the customer within the production month. Capacity represents the reservation of the renewable generation facility and conveys the ability to call on the renewable generation facility to produce electricity when needed by the customer. The nature of our performance obligation as it relates to capacity is to stand ready to deliver power. This represents a single performance obligation transferred over time, which generally represents a monthly obligation. Accordingly, capacity revenue is recognized on a monthly basis. The performance obligation for RECs is recognized at a point-in-time; however, the timing of revenue recognition is the same, as the generation of renewable energy and the recognition of REC revenues generally occur concurrently.\n\nNon-utility operating revenues are also derived from servicing appliances for customers at MERC. These contracts customarily have a duration of one year or less and consist of a single performance obligation satisfied over time. We use a time-based output method to recognize revenues monthly for the service fee.\n\nConsistent with the timing of when we recognize revenue, customer billings for the renewable generation and servicing revenues generally occur on a monthly basis, with payments typically due in full within 30 days.\n\nAs part of the construction of the We Power electric generating units, we capitalized interest during construction, which is included in property, plant, and equipment. As allowed by the PSCW, we collected these carrying costs from WE's utility customers during construction. The equity portion of these carrying costs was recorded as a contract liability, which is presented as deferred revenue, net on our balance sheets. We continually amortize the deferred carrying costs to revenues over the related lease term that We Power has with WE. During 2023, 2022, and 2021, we recorded $23.5 million, $23.4 million, and $23.3 million, respectively, of revenues related to these deferred carrying costs.\n\nOther Operating Revenues\n\nAlternative Revenues\n\nAlternative revenues are created from programs authorized by regulators that allow our utilities to record additional revenues by adjusting rates in the future, usually as a surcharge applied to future billings, in response to past activities or completed events. Alternative revenue programs allow compensation for the effects of weather abnormalities, other external factors, or demand side management initiatives. Alternative revenue programs can also provide incentive awards if the utility achieves certain objectives and in other limited circumstances. We record alternative revenues when the regulator-specified conditions for recognition have been met. We reverse these alternative revenues as the customer is billed, at which time this revenue is presented as revenues from contracts with customers.\n\nBelow is a summary of the alternative revenue programs at our utilities:\n\n•The rates of PGL, NSG, and MERC include decoupling mechanisms. These mechanisms differ by state and allow the utilities to recover or refund the differences between actual and authorized margins for certain customer classes.\n•MERC’s rates include a conservation improvement program rider, which includes a financial incentive for meeting energy savings goals.\n•WE and WPS provide wholesale electric service to customers under market-based rates and FERC formula rates. The customer is charged a base rate each year based upon a formula using prior year actual costs and customer demand. A true-up is calculated based on the difference between the amount billed to customers for the demand component of their rates and what the actual cost of service was for the year. The true-up can result in an amount that we will recover from or refund to the customer. We consider the true-up portion of the wholesale electric revenues to be alternative revenues."

This represents an approximate increase of 19%.\n\n2. Accounts payable and accrued expenses decreased slightly from $1,314.8 million in 2022 to $1,294.4 million in 2023, a reduction of about $20.4 million.\n\n3. If one considers a basic liquidity indicator such as the ratio of cash and cash equivalents to accounts payable and accrued expenses, this ratio improved from approximately 0.94 ($1,234.7M / $1,314.8M) in 2022 to about 1.13 ($1,469.2M / $1,294.4M) in 2023.\n\nThus, the evolution of Invesco Ltd.'s liquidity position indicates a substantive improvement from 2022 to 2023. The significant increase in cash and cash equivalents combined with a modest decline in accounts payable and accrued expenses suggests that the company's ability to meet its short-term liabilities has strengthened."

        "F5's Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) programs are guided by our fundamental principle to “do the right thing” for each other, our customers, our shareholders, and our communities.\nEnvironmental. In fiscal year 2024, F5 took a step forward in our environmental commitments by successfully obtaining the Science Based Target Initiative's verification for our 2030 target to reduce both absolute Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 50% and absolute Scope 3 emissions by 43% from the 2021 baseline. We plan to meet this target by optimizing our energy use, sourcing more renewable energy, and enhancing the sustainability of our products and supply chain processes.\nAs evidence of our progress towards our science-based target, F5’s most recent annual ESG report in April 2024 disclosed a 31% reduction in our total emissions during fiscal year 2023. This achievement was driven by a 40% reduction in Scope 1 and 2 emissions and a 30% reduction in Scope 3 emissions. To ensure the integrity of our emissions reporting, F5 also secured third-party verification for our Scope 1 and 2 emissions data from fiscal year 2023. The auditor’s verification letter is available on page 20 of F5’s 2023 ESG report at f5.com under the ‘‘Company — Investor Relations — ESG’’ section.\nSocial. In addition to the employee programs and benefits outlined in the Human Capital Management section above, we continue to prioritize F5 Global Good, the community development initiative that amplifies our employee engagement and diversity and inclusion programs. We are proud that employees direct the entirety of Global Good’s donations, through both the Company matching program and grant selection committees. In fiscal year 2024, two-thirds of all employees worldwide participated in Global Good programs, volunteering over 15,000 hours and directing the entirety of F5’s donations, through both the Company matching program and grant selection committees. F5 and our employees donated over $3.9 million to more than 3,200 non-profits worldwide in fiscal year 2024.\nGovernance. Our guiding principle to \"do the right thing\" is set forth in F5’s Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, with oversight led by our Board of Directors.\nIn fiscal year 2024, F5 added a Risk Committee to assist its Board of Directors’ oversight of the Company’s strategic, legal & regulatory, talent management, technology & cybersecurity, environmental (including climate), and other operational risks. The Risk Committee’s responsibilities include monitoring, reviewing, and providing guidance regarding applicable risk policies and processes, as well as providing feedback on related risk analysis and reporting. In conjunction, the Risk Committee reviews and assesses F5’s cybersecurity risk exposure and evaluates the adequacy and effectiveness of related risk management processes and policies, including data privacy and security, business continuity, and operational risks.",
        "Nearly all organizations today find themselves at the convergence of two significant trends: the evolution of applications as the center of their businesses and their customers’ digital lives, and the escalation of threats against those applications. This presents a tremendous challenge as many companies now manage complex application portfolios comprising older legacy and newer modern technologies and infrastructures. In our 2024 State of Application Strategy Report, the majority of organizations said they operate both legacy and modern application architectures, and operate in multiple clouds. Companies are forced to deploy separate, and often inconsistent, security controls across these hybrid environments, creating operational complexity and expanding the potential threat surface.\nOver the past several years, F5 has significantly expanded its software and SaaS offerings to deliver a broad portfolio of solutions to help customers address the complexity and risk in today’s hybrid IT environments. Through its BIG-IP, F5 NGINX, and F5 Distributed Cloud Services product families, F5 offers a range of integrated, artificial intelligence- and machine learning-driven solutions that support performance and protect both legacy and modern applications and APIs across data center, cloud, and edge locations.Our multicloud application security and delivery solutions reduce our customers’ operational complexity and costs, enabling scalability, security, and optimization for legacy and modern applications and APIs, across any infrastructure. F5 leverages a near real-time collection of application telemetry, machine learning and artificial intelligence, and toolchain automation to enable rapid response to changes in application performance, availability, and security threats with little to no human interaction.\nKey components of our strategy include:\nSolving multicloud application security and delivery challenges\nThrough our organic innovation and inorganic investments, we have created the broadest portfolio of multicloud application security and delivery technologies in the market and as a result, we are capable of serving any application or API in any environment. Our BIG-IP family primarily serves traditional applications on premises, co-located or in cloud environments. Our F5 NGINX family serves modern, container-native and microservices-based applications and APIs. Our F5 Distributed Cloud Services is a portfolio of SaaS and managed services serving both traditional and modern applications where a SaaS-deployment model is preferred. As a result of this broad portfolio, we are the only provider capable of supporting our customers’ modern and legacy application security and delivery needs across any environment — on premises, co-located, in a cloud or at the edge — with the added flexibility of multiple deployment models including SaaS, managed services, packaged software, and hardware offerings.\nTransforming how customers experience F5\nAs we expand the role we play for our customers, we are also transforming how our customers experience F5. Our goal is to create a unified and frictionless F5 experience for our customers. Over the last several years, we have made it easier for our customers to procure, deploy, use, manage, and upgrade our technologies. We also have taken steps to integrate the customer experience across our growing portfolio by simplifying the product naming and rebranding of several acquired and integrated solutions as part of our F5 Distributed Cloud Services platform.\nGoing forward we will leverage and grow our foundational capabilities in data and insights, digital sales, and SaaS-delivered capabilities to deliver consistent world-class customer experiences, including simple, integrated and friction-free consumption of our technologies. We will continue to improve customer awareness and understanding of F5’s expanded portfolio with a focus on both user and buying personas, and business needs and intend to enhance our digital customer experiences to deliver both growth and efficiency.\nF5 is leveraging AI to accelerate the strength of both our current and future offerings. F5 uses AI in its application delivery and security solutions to support performance and efficacy. Today, our customers are able to further benefit from our four-pronged AI strategy. First, our current portfolio is positioned to solve security and performance challenges associated with new AI workloads. Second, we are leveraging AI models in our current data fabric in order to enhance our existing products. Third, we are working to build new offerings based on the changing application and data security landscapes and the customer needs associated with these changes. Finally, we are pursuing partnerships with AI players to help secure and deliver AI workloads.\nCapturing growth in security and software-as-a-service\nIn the previous decade, our customers were focused on protecting their networks from attacks. Today, attackers are targeting applications with threats like malware, bots, and API penetration. Through both organic and inorganic investment, we have expanded our application security portfolio and the deployment models through which customers can consume our solutions. F5’s leading security capabilities combined with our hybrid multicloud approach enables our customers to deploy a consistent security posture across their entire application estate.\nWe continue to focus investment in expanding our SaaS-based offerings within F5 Distributed Cloud Services, our comprehensive unified, security, networking, and application delivery service. F5 Distributed Cloud Service is also now helping our BIG-IP and NGINX customers expand and simplify their visibility and management of these solutions. F5 Distributed Cloud enables our customers to choose the best location and architecture for their application portfolio while easing the operational burden of securing and delivering applications across public, private and edge clouds."

      "ground_truth": "Analysis of the investing activities reveals noticeable shifts over the three-year period, particularly in the areas of fixed maturities acquired – available for sale and the corresponding proceeds from securities sold. In 2021, the company invested $8,825 million in such securities and generated proceeds of $1,916 million from sales. In 2022, the cost decreased to $7,344 million, and the sales proceeds also decreased to $1,403 million, indicating a slowdown or reduction in activity. However, in 2023 both figures saw a significant rebound; the cost of fixed maturities acquired increased to $10,653 million while proceeds from their sale jumped to $3,849 million. This pattern suggests that after a period of lower investment and divestment activity in 2022, the company aggressively expanded its portfolio in 2023 and simultaneously increased its disposition of available-for-sale securities, potentially reflecting a strategic reallocation or rebalancing of its investment portfolio."

        "The Company’s segments - Engine Products, Fastening Systems, Engineered Structures, and Forged Wheels - are subject to substantial and intense competition in the markets they serve. Although Howmet believes its advanced technology, manufacturing processes and experience provide advantages to Howmet’s customers, such as high quality and superior mechanical properties that meet the Company’s customers’ most stringent requirements, many of the products Howmet makes can be produced by competitors using similar types of manufacturing processes as well as alternative forms of manufacturing. Despite intense competition, Howmet continues as a market leader in most of its principal markets. We believe that factors such as Howmet’s technological expertise, state-of-the-art capabilities, capacity, quality, engaged employees and long-standing customer relationships enable the Company to maintain its competitive position.\nPrincipal competitors include Berkshire Hathaway Inc., through its 2016 acquisition of Precision Castparts Corporation and subsidiaries, for titanium and titanium-based alloys, precision forgings, seamless rolled rings, investment castings, including airfoils, and aerospace fasteners; VSMPO (Russia) for titanium and titanium-based alloys and precision forgings; Allegheny Technologies, Inc.’s High-Performance Materials & Components segment for titanium and titanium-based alloys and precision forgings; Lisi Aerospace (France) for aerospace fasteners; and Aubert & Duval (part of Eramet Group in France) for precision forgings. Other competitors include Doncasters Group Ltd. (U.K.) and Consolidated Precision Products Corp. (owned by Warburg Pincus and Berkshire Partners) for investment castings; Weber Metals (part of Otto Fuchs) for precision forgings; and Forgital and Frisa (Mexico) for seamless rings.\nForged Wheels competes against aluminum and steel wheel suppliers in the commercial transportation industry under the product brand name Alcoa® Wheels for the major regions that it serves (North America, Europe, Japan, China, South America, and Australia). Its larger aluminum wheel competitors are Accuride Corporation, Speedline (member of the Ronal Group), Nippon Steel Corporation, Dicastal, Alux, and Wheels India Limited. In recent years, Forged Wheels has seen an increase in the number of aluminum wheel suppliers (both forged and cast aluminum wheels) from China, Taiwan, India and South Korea attempting to penetrate the global commercial transportation market.\nSeveral of Howmet’s largest customers have captive superalloy furnaces for producing airfoil investment castings for their own use. Many other companies around the world also produce superalloy investment castings, and some of these companies currently compete with Howmet in the aerospace and other markets, while others are capable of competing with the Company should they choose to do so.\nInternational competition in the investment castings, fasteners, rings and forgings markets may also increase in the future as a result of strategic alliances among engine original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”), aero-structure prime contractors, and overseas companies, especially in developing markets, particularly where “offset” or “local content” requirements create purchase obligations with respect to products manufactured in or directed to a particular country."

Other strategic advantages include its production capacity, the quality of its operations, an engaged workforce, and long-standing customer relationships that help to reinforce competitive ties. \n\nHowever, while these strategies are clearly outlined, the reference does not supply direct financial data or explicit key valuation indicators (such as price-to-earnings ratios, EV/EBITDA multiples, or cash flow performance metrics) that would quantitatively reflect how these strategies impact its market valuation. As a result, any inference about the impact of these strategies on key valuation metrics must be qualitative in nature. In practice, investors might view Howmet’s competitive positioning favorably, expecting that its technological edge and quality manufacturing processes could justify premium valuation multiples relative to peers.

      "ground_truth": "The data allows us to identify segment-level trends in capital expenditure allocations over the three-year period. Key observations include:\n\n1. **Safety and Industrial**: Capital expenditures have declined steadily from $512 million in 2021 to $339 million in 2022 and further to $285 million in 2023. This reduction may indicate that this segment is either completing major past investments or is being deliberately de‐invested in favor of other areas. A lower CAPEX could slow infrastructure or capacity expansion in this segment unless offset by operational improvements.\n\n2. **Transportation and Electronics**: This segment shows a marked increase, with capital expenditures rising from $453 million in 2021 to $562 million in 2022, and further to $723 million in 2023. The rising CAPEX indicates strategic investment, likely geared toward technology upgrades, production capacity expansion, or competitive positioning. This trend points to a commitment to growth in this segment and may yield future competitive advantages and increased market share.\n\n3. **Health Care**: Here the trend is less clear. The expenditures increased slightly from $249 million in 2021 to $272 million in 2022 but then dropped to $228 million in 2023. This fluctuation could signal a reassessment of investment priorities or short-term cost containment, potentially affecting the growth trajectory if underinvestment persists.\n\n4. **Consumer**: Similarly, capital expenditures in the Consumer segment saw a rise from $109 million in 2021 to $146 million in 2022, then a decline to $105 million in 2023. This could reflect a strategic pivot or a temporary market adjustment, which might impact future competitiveness if underinvestment continues.\n\n5. **Corporate and Unallocated**: Investments in this category dropped from $453 million in 2021 to $257 million in 2022, with a slight recovery to $274 million in 2023. Since this category often covers shared services and unallocated future growth projects, the decrease suggests a tightened control or reallocation of funds to more growth-centric segments.\n\nOverall, while the total company capital expenditure is relatively flat (peaking at $1,749 million in 2022 before reverting to $1,615 million in 2023), the reallocation of funds is significant. The increase in Transportation and Electronics' CAPEX suggests that 3M is prioritizing areas with strong growth or technological potential. Conversely, reduced spending in Safety and Industrial, Health Care, and Consumer might imply either a shift in strategic focus or efforts to enhance efficiency.\n\nThese trends could impact 3M’s future growth prospects by directing resources toward segments expected to yield higher returns or capture emerging market opportunities. The increased investment in Transportation and Electronics, for example, may help the company secure a competitive edge in rapidly evolving sectors. However, underinvestment in segments like Safety and Industrial or Consumer could risk slower expansion in those areas unless offset by efficiency gains or market consolidation."

      "ground_truth": "The provided data explains that the Board of Directors, through its audit committee, plays a central role in overseeing the company's cybersecurity policies and practices. Specifically, the Board and the audit committee:\n\n1. **Oversight & Regular Review**: The audit committee is responsible for reviewing and monitoring the company's cybersecurity and information security policies along with the internal controls related to cybersecurity. This involves regular assessments of risk mitigation strategies, ensuring that security procedures are effective and up-to-date.\n\n2. **Reporting Structure**: The Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) reports to the audit committee at least quarterly and to the Board annually. This reporting structure ensures that high-level management is kept informed about cybersecurity risks and incidents, allowing the Board to make informed decisions on whether additional measures are needed.\n\n3. **Integration with Enterprise Risk Management (ERM)**: Cybersecurity risk assessments and mitigation strategies are integrated into the broader ERM framework. This integration reinforces that cybersecurity is a critical component of overall risk management, with the audit committee playing a key role in ensuring that the organization’s approach is both comprehensive and responsive to emerging threats.\n\n4. **Independent Reviews and External Advice**: The audit committee benefits from the inclusion of independent third-party evaluations and external benchmarks. This external oversight further strengthens the policies and helps ensure that the company is aligned with evolving industry standards, such as the ISO 27001-2022 certification held at the headquarters.\n\nThe oversight provided by the Board, particularly via the audit committee, can help mitigate potential financial losses in several ways:\n\n• By ensuring that robust cybersecurity policies and risk management strategies are in place, the likelihood of a successful breach or security incident is reduced, thereby protecting intellectual property and sensitive business data.\n• Regular monitoring and reporting allow for early detection of vulnerabilities or incidents. Early remediation minimizes the potential for extended downtime or financial damage due to breaches.\n• Well-governed cybersecurity measures can help maintain customer and supplier trust, thereby preserving the company’s market reputation and minimizing the costs associated with breaches, such as legal liabilities, remediation, or regulatory fines.\n\nOverall, strong Board and audit committee oversight acts as a crucial control mechanism that not only helps the company address and mitigate cybersecurity risks but also safeguards its financial health by reducing the potential for material adverse events."

        "U.S. Cell Phone Litigation \n\nMicrosoft Mobile Oy, a subsidiary of Microsoft, along with other handset manufacturers and network operators, is a defendant in 45 lawsuits filed in the Superior Court for the District of Columbia by individual plaintiffs who allege that radio emissions from cellular handsets caused their brain tumors and other adverse health effects. We assumed responsibility for these claims in our agreement to acquire Nokia’s Devices and Services business and have been substituted for the Nokia defendants. Twelve of these cases were consolidated for certain pre-trial proceedings; the remaining cases are stayed. In a separate 2009 decision, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia held that adverse health effect claims arising from the use of cellular handsets that operate within the U.S. Federal Communications Commission radio frequency emission guidelines (“FCC Guidelines”) are pre-empted by federal law. The plaintiffs allege that their handsets either operated outside the FCC Guidelines or were manufactured before the FCC Guidelines went into effect. The lawsuits also allege an industry-wide conspiracy to manipulate the science and testing around emission guidelines. \n\nIn 2013, the defendants in the consolidated cases moved to exclude the plaintiffs’ expert evidence of general causation on the basis of flawed scientific methodologies. In 2014, the trial court granted in part and denied in part the defendants’ motion to exclude the plaintiffs’ general causation experts. The defendants filed an interlocutory appeal to the District of Columbia Court of Appeals challenging the standard for evaluating expert scientific evidence. In October 2016, the Court of Appeals issued its decision adopting the standard advocated by the defendants and remanding the cases to the trial court for further proceedings under that standard. The plaintiffs have filed supplemental expert evidence, portions of which were stricken by the court. A hearing on general causation took place in September of 2022. In April of 2023, the court granted defendants’ motion to strike the testimony of plaintiffs’ experts that cell phones cause brain cancer and entered an order excluding all of plaintiffs’ experts from testifying. The parties agreed to a stipulated dismissal of the consolidated cases to allow plaintiffs to appeal the expert testimony order. Plaintiffs appealed the court’s order in August of 2023, and the parties have filed their briefs on the appeal. A hearing on the status of the stayed cases occurred in December of 2023. In July 2024, the court entered summary judgment in nine of the stayed cases on the grounds that plaintiffs had agreed to be bound by the general causation outcome in the consolidated cases.\n\nIrish Data Protection Commission Matter\n\nIn 2018, the Irish Data Protection Commission (“IDPC”) began investigating a complaint against LinkedIn as to whether LinkedIn’s targeted advertising practices violated the recently implemented European Union General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”). Microsoft cooperated throughout the period of inquiry. In April 2023, the IDPC provided LinkedIn with a non-public preliminary draft decision alleging GDPR violations and proposing a fine. In July 2024, the IDPC provided LinkedIn with a revised non-public draft decision. There is no set timeline for the IDPC to issue a final decision, at which time Microsoft will consider its options to appeal.\n\nOther Contingencies \n\nWe also are subject to a variety of other claims and suits that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business. Although management currently believes that resolving claims against us, individually or in aggregate, will not have a material adverse impact in our consolidated financial statements, these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and management’s view of these matters may change in the future. \n\nAs of June 30, 2024, we accrued aggregate legal liabilities of $641 million. While we intend to defend these matters vigorously, adverse outcomes that we estimate could reach approximately $600 million in aggregate beyond recorded amounts are reasonably possible. Were unfavorable final outcomes to occur, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact in our consolidated financial statements for the period in which the effects become reasonably estimable."

      "category": "Legal",
      "ground_truth": "Microsoft appears to be taking a proactive and multi-pronged approach to managing its exposure to various legal liabilities. For instance, in the U.S. cell phone litigation, the company has employed legal strategies such as aggressively challenging the admissibility of plaintiffs’ expert testimony, leveraging consolidated case proceedings and summary judgments, and engaging in appeals to limit its exposure to potential adverse verdicts. These steps indicate that Microsoft is actively using legal arguments (for example, relying on federal preemption under FCC Guidelines and improved judicial scrutiny of expert methodologies) to potentially narrow its liability.\n\nLikewise, in the regulatory context (as seen in the Irish Data Protection Commission's investigation concerning LinkedIn's targeted advertising practices), Microsoft has demonstrated a willingness to cooperate with regulators by providing relevant documentation and responding cooperatively during the inquiry process. This proactive stance helps in mitigating regulatory risk and preserving the company’s reputation.\n\nIn terms of risk management measures influencing capital allocation and long-term investment performance, several points stand out:\n\n1. Capital Adequacy and Liability Provisioning: Microsoft has accrued legal liabilities of $641 million (as of June 30, 2024), with an acknowledgment that a further adverse outcome up to an estimated $600 million in aggregate is reasonably possible. These accruals show that the company is quantitatively preparing for potential risks in its financial statements. This forward-looking provisioning helps to ensure that any adverse financial impact is incorporated into its decision-making process, thus protecting the firm’s capital allocation strategy.\n\n2. Maintaining Financial Flexibility: By setting aside reserves and aggressively managing litigation risk, Microsoft is likely positioning itself to preserve cash flows. This in turn safeguards the funds available for reinvestment into core business activities such as R&D, strategic acquisitions, and capital expenditures which are critical for long-term growth.\n\n3. Stakeholder Confidence: Proactive litigation and regulatory management enhance transparency and help ensure that potential liabilities are well understood by investors. This can lower the company’s perceived risk premium, potentially reducing its cost of capital and allowing more favorable terms for funding future investments.\n\n4. Strategic Reinvestment: The disciplined approach to risk management may allow Microsoft to continue its long-term strategy of investment in innovation and competitive positioning, even in the face of isolated litigation or regulatory challenges. If legal exposures are effectively contained within expected ranges, capital can be more reliably allocated to initiatives that drive sustainable growth and shareholder value.\n\nOverall, these actions not only mitigate potential immediate financial disruptions but also support a broader capital allocation strategy that prioritizes resilience, financial flexibility, and long-term investment performance. By actively managing legal and regulatory risks, Microsoft aims to limit any material adverse impacts on its financial health and retain the ability to invest in future growth opportunities."

Looking at the individual components:\n\n• RSUs: The expense for restricted stock units rose from roughly $330.1 million in 2021 to $387.0 million in 2023 (an increase of about 17%), making RSUs the dominant component in the compensation mix over this period.\n\n• RSAs: The expense associated with restricted stock awards dropped sharply from about $10.1 million in 2021 to $1.8 million in 2023, an approximate 83% decline, indicating a significant reduction in the use or expense recognition of RSAs.\n\n• Employee Stock Purchase Plan: The related expense was $23.6 million in 2021, increased to $34.2 million in 2022, and then decreased to about $18.8 million in 2023. This volatility suggests adjustments in plan participation, pricing assumptions, or grant timing over the years.\n\nImplications for the company’s cost structure and compensation trends include a strategic shift towards RSUs, which are increasingly used to align employee incentives with the company’s long‐term performance. The marked reduction in RSAs implies a deliberate move away from that form of equity compensation. Meanwhile, the overall modest increase in total expense, despite these compositional shifts, may indicate a managed approach in controlling noncash compensation costs while still using equity to attract and retain talent. This blend of changes reflects evolving compensation policies aimed at optimizing cost structure, mitigating risk related to over‐concentration in any single form of equity award, and aligning with strategic goals related to employee retention and performance."

Additionally, management's timing strategy might have been influenced by these market developments. The lower average price in August followed by a significantly higher price in September could imply that management executed repurchases opportunistically, taking advantage of favorable prices when available but also continuing the program as market conditions evolved. Alternatively, the higher volumes and prices in September might reflect a need to complete planned repurchases before anticipated further increases in share price, thereby reducing future risks."

This reduction in liquidity may elevate short-term financial risk, especially if revenues do not immediately increase to offset these expenditures or if the company needs to incur additional debt to finance these investments.\n\nConversely, if these capital expenditures successfully expand the market reach, improve operational efficiencies, and generate higher future revenues, they can enhance the company's competitive positioning. In the longer term, such investments have the potential to strengthen overall financial stability by driving growth and profitability, which can eventually improve cash flows and restore liquidity.

      "ground_truth": "The provided cash flow data includes a line item for Capital Expenditures (capex) in the cash flows from investing activities, which allows us to assess the trend over the three years. In 2022, Oracle reported capital expenditures of $4,511 million. In 2023, capex jumped considerably to $8,695 million, indicating a strong investment in infrastructure, technology, or capacity expansion—likely linked to bolstering its cloud and data center capabilities. In 2024, while still high, capex decreased to $6,866 million. This reduction in 2024 compared to 2023, although remaining above the 2022 level, could suggest that Oracle made a peak investment in 2023 to upgrade or expand its systems and has since then moderated its spending, possibly as projects concluded or to optimize capital allocation.\n\nKey insights from these trends include:\n1. A significant increase in capex from 2022 to 2023 indicates a period of aggressive investment in growth and capability expansion.\n2. The moderation in 2024, while still more than in 2022, may indicate a strategic adjustment—whereby Oracle continues investing in growth but is now more focused or is rebalancing its expenditure portfolio.\n3. Overall, the figures indicate that Oracle is actively investing in its infrastructure to support future growth, with a noticeable investment peak in 2023 that now appears to be stabilizing or being fine-tuned in 2024.\n\nThese trends are valuable for understanding how Oracle is positioning itself in terms of capacity for future revenue growth and competitive technology development."

      "ground_truth": "Analysis of the data shows that both basic and diluted earnings per share (EPS) have varied over the three reported fiscal periods. In FY 2022 (ending January 29, 2022), the company reported a basic EPS of $4.90 and a diluted EPS of $4.87. In FY 2023 (ending January 28, 2023), both basic and diluted EPS fell to $4.40 and $4.38 respectively, representing roughly a 10% decline from the previous year. Then in FY 2024 (ending February 3, 2024), there was a recovery with basic EPS rising to $5.59 and diluted EPS to $5.56 — a significant improvement (nearly a 27% increase from FY 2023 and about 14% higher than FY 2022 levels).\n\nThis EPS improvement is partly attributable to the company’s net earnings performance. Net earnings decreased from $1,722.6 million in FY 2022 to $1,512.0 million in FY 2023 and then increased to $1,874.5 million in FY 2024. Additionally, the weighted-average shares outstanding declined over the same periods. Basic average shares dropped from 351.5 million in FY 2022 to 343.5 million in FY 2023 and further to 335.2 million in FY 2024. This reduction in the share count suggests that share buybacks or other capital management strategies may have been implemented, thereby enhancing EPS even when the absolute net earnings changes were moderate.\n\nImplications for shareholder value include:\n1. Enhanced per-share profitability: The increase in EPS in FY 2024 reflects not only improved net earnings but also the benefit of a lower denominator (fewer outstanding shares). This indicates that shareholders are earning more on a per-share basis, which is a positive signal for valuation.\n2. Active capital allocation: The reduction in weighted-average shares outstanding suggests that management might be returning capital to shareholders through share repurchase programs. Such actions typically improve shareholder value by increasing the ownership stake of remaining investors.\n3. Market perception: Improved EPS figures, when combined with disciplined capital management, can increase investor confidence and potentially lead to an improved stock price as the market rewards higher per-share profitability.\n\nOverall, the changes in EPS, particularly when considered alongside the declining share count, imply stronger per-share earnings and a potentially favorable impact on shareholder value."

        "Cybersecurity Risk Management and StrategyOur enterprise risk management framework considers cybersecurity risk alongside other company risks, as part of our overall riskassessment process. We leverage an industry-leading framework, the National Institute of Standards and Technology CybersecurityFramework, and assess our maturity against that framework in partnership with an independent firm on an annual basis. We assess and manage our cybersecurity risk using various mechanisms, starting with threat intelligence, which provides us anecessary viewpoint to help us identify trends, understand how certain attacks may affect us, and prepare for evolutions in threat actorbehavior that may require changes to our security posture. To drive readiness, we perform periodic adversarial testing of ourcybersecurity posture through penetration testing, using both internal resources and external expertise, as well as table-top and “redteam” exercises to understand where processes or controls may be insufficient based on adversarial techniques.Our internal audit team performs regular assessments of our program and selected components. We also leverage retrospectives fromprevious cybersecurity incidents to understand weaknesses and to improve our security controls. We assess our critical suppliersregularly for cybersecurity risk and prescribe remediation activities when necessary. As a part of a collaborative defense approach, weregularly participate in multiple cybersecurity forums to share threat intelligence, best practices, and points of caution.We train our employees through annual security training, phishing simulations, and regular communications about timelycybersecurity topics and threats. We have a documented and well-tested cybersecurity incident response plan that guides us inresponding, containing, and eradicating cybersecurity threats that have breached our preventative controls. We regularly practicetechnical recovery, and we maintain cybersecurity insurance.Cybersecurity GovernanceOur cybersecurity program is led by our Chief Digital and Technology Officer (CDTO) and Vice President of Cyber Security. OurVice President of Cyber Security, who reports to our CDTO, has a master’s degree in information assurance, and more than 20 yearsof experience working in this field, including more than 12 years with General Mills. He has strategic and operational responsibilityfor all aspects of the company’s cybersecurity program, from how cyber risks are identified, to how General Mills detects, responds,contains, and recovers from cybersecurity threats.The Audit Committee of our Board of Directors provides oversight for our cybersecurity program. The Audit Committee receivesregular updates from management on the effectiveness of our cybersecurity program, reviews plans on how management willcontinually mature the program, and receives updates on special topics that help the committee provide effective oversight of theprogram.  Our Security & Resilience Governance Committee provides oversight and governance for the company’s cybersecurity risk throughquarterly meetings, monthly dashboard reporting on management-aligned program performance targets, and as-needed updates oncybersecurity incidents. This committee is composed of our Chief Financial Officer, General Counsel, Chief Human ResourcesOfficer, Chief Supply Chain Officer, and CDTO.Like most companies, our systems are continually subjected to cybersecurity threats. Although we have not experienced a materialcybersecurity breach, we cannot guarantee that we will not experience a cyber threat or incident in the future.

First, by conducting annual NIST maturity assessments, the company systematically evaluates its cybersecurity posture against industry-recognized standards, identifying vulnerabilities and areas for improvement. This continuous evaluation ensures that the company remains aware of potential weak points and can take corrective action before these issues translate into operational disruptions.\n\nSecond, red team exercises and adversarial testing simulate realistic cyber-attacks, allowing General Mills to test the effectiveness of its security controls under pressure. These exercises uncover gaps in defenses and help refine incident response plans, reducing the likelihood and impact of a successful breach. In turn, this preparedness minimizes potential operational downtime, data loss, and associated financial costs such as remediation expenses, regulatory fines, and reputational damage.\n\nTogether, these initiatives contribute to a robust risk management framework that not only protects critical systems and data but also supports the company’s broader financial stability. By identifying risks early and implementing ongoing improvements, General Mills reduces the probability of significant cybersecurity events that could disrupt operations and impact the bottom line."

        "Our business activities rely extensively on technology and software, including the systems used by our business partners, regulators and customers. In addition, our activities involve the use and retention of confidential data and information. These activities make us susceptible to cyberattacks. We employ the following activities, processes and strategies to help evaluate, manage and address these risks.\n•Strategy: We maintain a Cybersecurity Strategy, or CSS, which emphasizes consideration of the nature of our business, ongoing intelligence collection regarding cybersecurity threats, and initiatives to specifically address prominent areas of cybersecurity risk. The CSS outlines the key priorities for our cybersecurity program and the methods by which our Information Security department seeks to accomplish those goals.\n•Governance and Leadership: Our Board of Directors is responsible for overseeing ICE’s risk management process, which includes management of general risks as well as specific risks, such as those relating to cybersecurity, facing our business. The Risk Committee of our Board of Directors has been delegated the primary responsibility for overseeing management’s identification and mitigation of cybersecurity risk. The Risk Committee is composed of board members with diverse expertise including cybersecurity, risk management, technology, business operations, regulatory and finance. The Risk Committee receives presentations on at least a quarterly basis from the CISO and senior members of the Enterprise Risk Management, or ERM, team, and the Chair of the Risk Committee provides reports to the full Board of Directors following such presentations. Our Information Security department is led by our CISO, who, in addition to quarterly presentations to the Risk Committee of our Board of Directors, also provides comprehensive reports to a dedicated internal governance committee at least quarterly outlining threat assessment, control performance, and ongoing enhancements. Our current CISO has served in the role since September 2021 and leads the cybersecurity program across our regulated futures and options exchanges, CCPs, trade repositories, equities venues, systemically important financial market utilities (SIFMUs) and our data services network and mortgage technology platforms. Prior to joining ICE, our CISO served as CISO of the White House Military Office and as CISO for two technology companies, and has more than 20 years of experience in cybersecurity, national security, and intelligence. Additionally, cybersecurity matters are reported to and discussed with a cross-subsidiary leadership committee and subsidiary boards. The Cyber Threat Intelligence team monitors multiple cybersecurity intelligence feeds and curates the applicable data. In the event we identify a cybersecurity threat applicable to us, we have a process to evaluate, escalate to Senior Management and respond to the threat faced. In addition, our CISO and other senior security leaders conduct periodic cybersecurity education sessions with our employees and directors. These sessions cover general cybersecurity topics as well as specific details regarding our cybersecurity program.\n•Risk Management: Cybersecurity risk management is integrated into our broader ERM framework. Our cybersecurity leadership team, in concert with our ERM team, assess threats and risks at least annually through the Enterprise Technology Risk Assessment process, which includes threat objective inherent risk score determination, identification of key and supporting controls, and resulting residual threat objective risk scores. Additionally, thematic threats such as sabotage, fraud, and theft of assets or customer data are used to frame our risk management activities. Asset theft often involves organized crime or financially motivated nations staging sophisticated, well-planned campaigns to steal significant cash, cryptocurrency, or equivalent assets. Our thematic threats, along with others, are evaluated by our Board of Directors as well as our Risk Committee, Corporate Risk Officer and Chief Information Security Officer, or CISO. The CSS provides the framework we use for assessing risk, prioritizing testing, identifying remedial actions and validating improvements. The CSS also provides for the deployment of external and internal teams of ethical hackers that operate alongside our traditional vulnerability detection processes.\n•Information Sharing: We recognize the importance of collaboration and information sharing among private sector firms in the financial services sector, across sectors, and with global public-sector agencies, when appropriate. Our cybersecurity leaders hold memberships and/or positions within the Financial Services Information Sharing and Analysis Center, or FS-ISAC, and the cross-sector Analysis and Resiliency Center, or ARC, in the U.S., the Financial Sector Cyber Collaboration Centre, or FSCCC, in the U.K., and similar organizations across the Europe, Middle East and Africa, or EMEA, and Asia Pacific, or APAC, regions.\n•Third-Party Risk Oversight: We maintain a third-party risk management program. Our Information Security team provides subject matter expertise to our vendor management team to help assess a vendors' cybersecurity processes. Vendors are assessed before we engage them, and once engaged, are monitored periodically to ensure that they maintain compliance with our cybersecurity standards.\n•Independent Security Attestation: We utilize both internal assessments and assessments by third-parties, including external security assessors, consultants and auditors, to evaluate and test our cybersecurity program. ICE’s Internal Audit, ERM, and Information Security Assurance teams conduct frequent assessments of varying scope to validate that our cybersecurity program controls and remediation processes are operating effectively. External auditors are contracted to perform annual Service Organization Controls, or SOC, report attestations of both business and security controls. In addition, our Cybersecurity Incident Response Plan is tested at least annually. Our internal \"red team\" conducts multiple tests each year driven by key cybersecurity risks. The results of these reviews alongside frequent regulatory and customer examinations are assessed, with any resulting mitigation activity assigned and tracked to remediation.\n•Controls: Our identification of risks and selection of cyber-related controls is performed in the context of the critical financial infrastructure we maintain and operate. Our ongoing threat assessments are intended to identify changes in external events and in our activities, infrastructure and processes that could necessitate reprioritization of risks and controls. The nature of our business activities mandates an emphasis on sabotage and asset theft as primary threats in addition to contemporary themes of data theft. Our focus on these threats leads to an emphasis on network security, social engineering controls, behavioral detection of insider threat, and deliberate and rehearsed recovery strategies.\nAlthough we do not believe that our business strategy, results of operations or financial condition have been materially adversely affected by any cybersecurity threats, we have been, and expect to continue to be, subject to cyberattacks, hacking and other cybersecurity risks.

      "ground_truth": "The integration of cybersecurity risk management into ICE’s broader enterprise risk framework is designed to systematically identify, assess, and mitigate cyber threats before they result in financial harm. In doing so, the system helps protect cash flows and reduce potential liabilities affecting valuation in several ways:\n\n1. Proactive Threat Assessment and Mitigation: By embedding cybersecurity within its overall enterprise risk management (ERM) framework, ICE continuously assesses risks using comprehensive techniques (such as threat intelligence, red team exercises, and vulnerability assessments). This proactive approach limits the frequency and severity of security breaches that could otherwise disrupt operations or require costly remediation.\n\n2. Robust Governance and Oversight: Cybersecurity is closely monitored by key governance bodies including the Board’s Risk Committee, internal risk committees, and senior security leadership. This multi-layered oversight ensures swift decision-making and resource allocation in response to emerging threats, which in turn preserves normal cash flows by minimizing unexpected costs from cyber incidents.\n\n3. Incident Response and Recovery: With defined processes that include annual testing of the Cybersecurity Incident Response Plan, ICE is well-prepared to react quickly if a breach occurs. A rapid, coordinated response helps reduce downtime and limits potential fault-finding or regulatory penalties, thereby protecting revenue streams and reducing the financial liabilities that could impact valuation.\n\n4. Third-Party and Continuous Monitoring: The integration extends to vendor management and third-party risk oversight, ensuring that external partners also meet strict cybersecurity criteria. This reduces the risk of supply chain cyber incidents, providing an added layer of protection to ICE’s operations and underlying cash flows.\n\nOverall, by embedding cybersecurity risk management within its broader ERM framework, ICE creates a resilient system that minimizes the likelihood of financially devastating cyber incidents. This approach reduces potential liabilities such as regulatory fines, legal claims, and reputational damage, thereby protecting ongoing cash flows and supporting a more stable company valuation."

We also expect to fund capital expenditures related to our SHOP and outpatient medical and research portfolio segments with the cash flows from the properties or through additional borrowings. We expect that these liquidity needs generally will be satisfied by a combination of the following: cash flows from operations, cash on hand, debt assumptions and financings (including secured financings), issuances of debt and equity securities, dispositions of assets (in whole or in part through joint venture arrangements with third parties) and borrowings under our revolving credit facilities and commercial paper program.\n\nTo the extent that unanticipated capital expenditure needs arise or significant borrowings are required, our liquidity may be affected adversely.

To date, we have not experienced a cybersecurity threat or incident that has resulted in a material adverse impact to our business or operations. However, we cannot guarantee that we will not experience such a threat or incident in the future, given the increasing sophistication of those responsible for cybersecurity incidents. While we seek to detect and investigate unauthorized attempts and attacks against our network and to prevent their occurrence where practicable through our internal processes and tools, we remain potentially vulnerable to known or unknown threats. In some instances, we can be unaware of a threat or incident or its magnitude and effects. Further, there is increasing regulation regarding responses to cybersecurity incidents, including reporting to regulators, which could subject us to additional liability and reputational harm. See \"Item 1A. Risk Factors\" for more information on our cybersecurity risks.\nWe aim to incorporate and align with industry best practices throughout our cybersecurity program. Our cybersecurity strategy focuses on implementing effective and efficient controls, technologies and other processes to assess, identify, manage and mitigate material cybersecurity risks. These include, among other things, having mechanisms in place to detect and monitor unusual network activity, utilizing vulnerability assessment scans and tools, and conducting external and internal penetration tests and security assessments using the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework. We engage third party experts to assist with numerous aspects of our cybersecurity program, including vulnerability assessment scans, penetration tests and security assessments. These outside experts are utilized on a rotating basis to enable us to receive multiple viewpoints on the security of our technological resources. Additionally, from time to time, our internal audit function, reviews and assesses various aspects of our cybersecurity program. We also engage in threat intelligence monitoring, including monitoring the dark web and zero-day vulnerability and attack information, and have processes in place to assess the potential cybersecurity impact or risk of any identified threats on our company, including potential impacts on our business partners and other parties with whom we share information. We actively engage with industry groups for peer benchmarking purposes and to stay current on best practices. We rely heavily on our vendors and other third party service providers in our clinical development activities as well as to manufacture and deliver our products, and a cybersecurity incident at a vendor or other third party service provider could have a material and adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. We have further processes in place to assess the cybersecurity risks associated with our vendors and other third-party service providers, and we require such providers to take appropriate precautions to protect our data and to notify us promptly in the event of any known or suspected data breach or cyber incident.\nOur cybersecurity program is integrated into our broader approach to risk management, and ultimate oversight for the program sits with our Board of Directors. The Board of Directors is aided by its Audit and Finance Committee, which regularly reviews our cybersecurity program with management and reports to the Board of Directors. Cybersecurity reviews by the Audit and Finance Committee or the Board of Directors generally occur at least twice annually, or more frequently as determined to be necessary or advisable.\nIncyte’s Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) runs our cybersecurity program. Our CISO, who holds numerous cybersecurity and related certifications, including Certified Information Systems Security Professional, reports in to our Chief Information Officer (CIO). Our CISO and CIO have extensive experience assessing and managing cybersecurity programs and cybersecurity risk. They regularly report directly to the Audit and Finance Committee or the Board of Directors on our cybersecurity program and our efforts to prevent, detect, mitigate and remediate cybersecurity incidents. In addition, we have an escalation process in place to inform senior management and the Board of Directors of any material issues as they arise."

Potential financial implications mentioned include:\n\n1. Increased Expenditures: Compliance with evolving cybersecurity regulations can lead to greater investments in technology, risk assessment tools, and third-party cybersecurity services (such as vulnerability scans and penetration tests).\n\n2. Liability and Reputational Risks: Non-compliance or breaches could result in penalties, legal liabilities, and damage to reputation, which can have a financial impact.\n\n3. Operational Costs: Additional regulatory requirements can necessitate more intensive internal reviews, audit functions, and potential incident response expenses.\n\nTo manage these potential costs and risks, Incyte has implemented a robust cybersecurity program that includes:\n\n• Regular monitoring and assessment of cybersecurity risks using industry best practices and the NIST Cybersecurity Framework.\n• Engaging third-party experts on a rotating basis to conduct vulnerability assessments and penetration tests, thereby providing multiple independent viewpoints.\n• Active oversight by its Chief Information Security Officer (CISO), Chief Information Officer (CIO), and further reporting to the Board of Directors and the Audit and Finance Committee at least twice annually.\n• Stringent requirements for vendors and third-party service providers to ensure they adhere to appropriate cybersecurity precautions and notify the company of any breaches.\n\nAlthough exact cost figures or detailed financial calculations are not provided, the described framework indicates that Incyte is proactively managing the risk of increased cybersecurity regulation by investing in a comprehensive governance and risk management structure. This integrated approach is intended to mitigate potential financial impacts should regulatory requirements tighten or should a cybersecurity incident occur."

This close proximity indicates that the transactions—whether initiated by the company or by employees exercising options or vesting shares—occurred under similar market conditions. The slight monthly variations (for example, in October the repurchase program price was lower than the employee price, while in November the situation was reversed, and in December, the repurchase program price was marginally higher) suggest that both the market prices and internal valuation methods were largely aligned. This consistency may imply that the company is effectively managing its repurchase program by buying shares at market prices that are deemed fair internally, and that employees are exercising their rights to equity benefits when prices are near those levels. Overall, it reflects a coherent internal valuation strategy and relatively stable market conditions during that period."

During the quarter, management did not purchase any shares in October but executed repurchases in November and December, which reduced the remaining available repurchase funds from approximately $373 million in October to $271 million in November and $243 million in December. This tiered execution indicates an opportunistic approach: management appears to be targeting attractive market conditions to buy back shares rather than using the full authorized $750 million amount all at once. They are balancing the immediate benefit of reducing share count and potentially improving earnings per share against maintaining a reserve of funds to capitalize on future opportunities. In short, the company’s capital allocation strategy emphasizes returning value to shareholders through buybacks while preserving the flexibility to adjust repurchase activities in response to market conditions and internal capital needs."

We use Segment EBITDA to compare profitability among the segments and evaluate business strategies. Segment EBITDA includes revenue and expenses that are controllable by the segment. Corporate general and administrative expenses are allocated to the segments based on usage, with shared expenses apportioned based on the segment's percentage of consolidated revenue. We calculate Segment EBITDA as Net Income attributable to LKQ stockholders excluding discontinued operations; depreciation, amortization; interest; gains and losses on debt extinguishment; income tax expense; restructuring and transaction related expenses (which includes restructuring expenses recorded in Cost of goods sold); change in fair value of contingent consideration liabilities; other gains and losses related to acquisitions, equity method investments, or divestitures; equity in losses and earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries; equity investment fair value adjustments; impairment charges; and direct impacts of the Ukraine/Russia conflict and related sanctions (including provisions for and subsequent adjustments to reserves for asset recoverability and expenditures to support our employees and their families).\nThe table below provides a reconciliation of Net Income to Segment EBITDA (in millions):\n\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023\t\t2022\t\t2021\nNet income\t$\t938 \t\t\t$\t1,150 \t\t\t$\t1,092 \t\nLess: net income attributable to continuing noncontrolling interest\t2 \t\t\t1 \t\t\t1 \t\nNet income attributable to LKQ stockholders\t936 \t\t\t1,149 \t\t\t1,091 \t\nLess: net (loss) income from discontinued operations\t(6)\t\t\t6 \t\t\t1 \t\nNet income from continuing operations attributable to LKQ stockholders\t942 \t\t\t1,143 \t\t\t1,090 \t\nAdjustments - continuing operations attributable to LKQ stockholders:\t\t\t\t\t\nDepreciation and amortization\t319 \t\t\t264 \t\t\t284 \t\nInterest expense, net of interest income\t186 \t\t\t70 \t\t\t70 \t\nLoss on debt extinguishment\t1 \t\t\t— \t\t\t24 \t\nProvision for income taxes\t306 \t\t\t385 \t\t\t331 \t\nEquity in earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries (1)\n(15)\t\t\t(11)\t\t\t(23)\t\nGains on foreign exchange contracts - acquisition related (2)\n(49)\t\t\t— \t\t\t— \t\nEquity investment fair value adjustments\t2 \t\t\t5 \t\t\t(11)\t\nRestructuring and transaction related expenses (3)\n65 \t\t\t20 \t\t\t19 \t\nRestructuring expenses - cost of goods sold (3)\n4 \t\t\t— \t\t\t— \t\nGain on disposal of businesses (4)\n— \t\t\t(159)\t\t\t— \t\nChange in fair value of contingent consideration liabilities\t— \t\t\t— \t\t\t1 \t\nGains on previously held equity interests\t(3)\t\t\t(1)\t\t\t— \t\nDirect impacts of Ukraine/Russia conflict (5)\n— \t\t\t3 \t\t\t— \t\nImpairment of net assets held for sale\t1 \t\t\t— \t\t\t— \t\nSegment EBITDA\t$\t1,759 \t\t\t$\t1,719 \t\t\t$\t1,785 \t\n \n(1)    Refer to Note 11, \"Equity Method Investments,\" for further information.\n(2)    Refer to Note 3, \"Business Combinations\" and Note 20, \"Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities\" for further information.\n(3)    Refer to Note 14, \"Restructuring and Transaction Related Expenses\" for further information.\n(4)    Refer to \"Other Divestitures (Not Classified in Discontinued Operations)\" in Note 4, \"Discontinued Operations and Divestitures,\" for further information.\n(5)    Adjustments include provisions for and subsequent adjustments to reserves for asset recoverability (receivables and inventory) and expenditures to support our employees and their families in Ukraine.\n\nThe following table presents capital expenditures by reportable segment (in millions):\n\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023\t\t2022\t\t2021\nCapital Expenditures\t\t\t\t\t\nWholesale - North America\n$\t118 \t\t\t$\t84 \t\t\t$\t113 \t\nEurope\t163 \t\t\t105 \t\t\t141 \t\nSpecialty\t41 \t\t\t19 \t\t\t23 \t\nSelf Service\t36 \t\t\t14 \t\t\t16 \t\nTotal capital expenditures\t$\t358 \t\t\t$\t222 \t\t\t$\t293 \t\n \nThe following table presents assets by reportable segment (in millions):\nDecember 31, 2023\t\tDecember 31, 2022\nReceivables, net of allowance for credit losses\t\t\t\nWholesale - North America(1)\n$\t470 \t\t\t$\t351 \t\nEurope\t580 \t\t\t547 \t\nSpecialty\t107 \t\t\t92 \t\nSelf Service\t8 \t\t\t8 \t\nTotal receivables, net of allowance for credit losses\t1,165 \t\t\t998 \t\nInventories\t\t\t\nWholesale - North America(1)\n1,217 \t\t\t822 \t\nEurope\t1,390 \t\t\t1,418 \t\nSpecialty\t475 \t\t\t469 \t\nSelf Service\t39 \t\t\t43 \t\nTotal inventories\t3,121 \t\t\t2,752 \t\nProperty, plant and equipment, net\t\t\t\nWholesale - North America(1)\n644 \t\t\t505 \t\nEurope\t642 \t\t\t547 \t\nSpecialty\t118 \t\t\t94 \t\nSelf Service\t112 \t\t\t90 \t\nTotal property, plant and equipment, net\t1,516 \t\t\t1,236 \t\nOperating lease assets, net\t\t\t\nWholesale - North America(1)\n615 \t\t\t541 \t\nEurope\t494 \t\t\t466 \t\nSpecialty\t84 \t\t\t85 \t\nSelf Service\t143 \t\t\t135 \t\nTotal operating lease assets, net\t1,336 \t\t\t1,227 \t\nOther unallocated assets\t7,941 \t\t\t5,825 \t\nTotal assets\t$\t15,079 \t\t\t$\t12,038 \t\n \n(1)    The increase in assets for the Wholesale - North America segment is primarily attributable to the Uni-Select Acquisition.\n\nWe report net receivables;

      "ground_truth": "The provided data allows us to assess changes in capital expenditure allocations across segments over the three-year period from 2021 to 2023 and to draw connections to strategic priorities and future growth investments. In particular:\n\n1. European Segment: \n   - In 2021, capital expenditures in Europe amounted to $141 million. This declined to $105 million in 2022 but then rebounded strongly to $163 million in 2023. \n   - The significant increase in 2023, compared to both 2021 and 2022, suggests a renewed focus on European operations. This indicates an intent to strengthen operations geographically in a market that serves diverse economic conditions, aligning with strategic goals for expansion and modernization in Europe.\n\n2. Specialty Segment: \n   - For the Specialty segment, the expenditures were $23 million in 2021, decreased slightly to $19 million in 2022, and then surged to $41 million in 2023. \n   - The nearly 78% increase from 2021 to 2023 in this segment reflects a strategic decision to invest more heavily in areas that likely offer higher margins or specialized product lines. This is consistent with a strategic shift toward segments where competitive positioning and future growth opportunities have been identified as priorities.\n\nOverall Strategic Alignment:\n   - The pattern of capital allocation—where the European and Specialty segments saw substantial increases in 2023—suggests that LKQ Corporation is allocating resources towards areas considered critical for future growth and competitive positioning. This re-allocation indicates a strategic emphasis on investing in markets and product lines where the company expects to secure long-term benefits, making these segments key targets for scaling operations, upgrading technology, or expanding capacity.\n   - In the context of the overall increase in total capital expenditures from $293 million in 2021 to $358 million in 2023, the accelerated spending in these two segments underscores their importance in the company’s broader growth and investment strategy.\n\nIn summary, the capital expenditure trends show that LKQ Corporation is channeling more funds into the European and Specialty segments in 2023, which aligns with a strategic focus on expanding market presence internationally and enhancing specialized product offerings to drive future growth."

This improvement suggests better control over costs relative to sales, or improved pricing strategies.\n• However, from FY 2023 to FY 2024, both the operating margin and net margin declined (operating margin from 16.06% to 14.97% and net margin from 12.15% to 11.52%). While net sales grew year-over-year, the margins dipped, implying that cost increases or other expenses may have outpaced revenue growth. \n\nThus, although Ulta Beauty showed signs of improved profitability and efficiency in 2023 compared to 2022, the decline in margins in 2024 signals a potential slowing in operational efficiency improvements, possibly due to rising costs or competitive pressures. Further analysis would be useful to determine specific factors affecting these changes."

Although the difference is modest, this could suggest that in November the market environment provided a slightly more favorable pricing opportunity, allowing the company to acquire shares at a marginal discount relative to the previous month. This may indicate that the management was responsive to minor market fluctuations, possibly approaching the repurchase with a view to taking advantage of transient undervaluation. It also lends some insight into their view on the stock’s intrinsic value: despite the small drop in price, the board's decision to repurchase indicates a continued belief in the company’s valuation, potentially signaling confidence in underlying fundamentals even amid modest short-term market variations."

        "Visa’s Approach to Cybersecurity\nAs a global company providing payment services to consumers and companies around the world, trust is an indispensable asset. A strong cybersecurity program is a key element to maintaining this trust. As a result, we consider cybersecurity risk one of our key enterprise risks and we assess, identify, and manage such risk as part of our overall enterprise risk management framework. See Item 1A for further discussion on our overall risk factors, including technology and cybersecurity risks.\nCybersecurity Program\nVisa’s cybersecurity program has been established to identify, analyze, mitigate, monitor, and govern cybersecurity risk and was designed around widely accepted international standards, such as ISO 27002 and the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards, as well as applicable legal and regulatory requirements. We implement our cybersecurity program primarily through our Key Controls, which define the requirements for the protection of Visa information and technology assets. All employees must complete annual training on our Key Controls and are required to comply with the requirements. Exceptions to the Key Controls must be approved by an established senior management working group, which is overseen by our Corporate Risk Committee (CRC), the management committee responsible for overseeing Visa’s cybersecurity program and other operational risks. The Key Controls are updated and reviewed annually by our Cybersecurity Governance, Risk and Compliance team and approved by management committees to ensure they continue to address evolving cybersecurity threats and associated legal and regulatory obligations.\nAs part of our overall business strategy, we have acquired a number of companies for which our full cybersecurity standards may not be appropriate. These designated entities may deliver products and services using systems which are not fully integrated with our standard technology platforms or hosted in our data centers. We have established a separate set of Key Controls for designated entities appropriate to their size and operations that are designed around the same widely accepted international standards noted above, but tailored to the operational reality and business needs of these entities. Regular reporting of our acquired entities’ cybersecurity program is provided to our Chief Information Security Officer (CISO), President of Technology, management committees and the board of directors. For additional information about our structural and organizational risks, see Item 1A of this report.\nIncident Response Plans\nVisa’s global cyber security incident response team provides monitoring of Visa networks and digital assets across three cyber fusion centers in the U.S., United Kingdom, and Singapore. In addition, Visa’s threat intelligence and research teams monitor commercial and government intelligence sources for new and emerging threats. Our cybersecurity awareness team regularly publishes and shares information with Visa employees on emerging threats, such as deepfake and generative AI-powered social engineering schemes.\nTo address significant cybersecurity incidents and other crisis events, we maintain a business incident response plan, which identifies key stakeholders, defines escalation processes, and sets the thresholds above which our cybersecurity, legal, and crisis management teams will inform management’s Executive and Disclosure Committees as well as when the CEO and his designee will inform the board of directors of an incident. For cybersecurity incidents below these crisis thresholds, we maintain subordinate incident response plans and standard operating procedures used by our security incident response team. Like many companies, we, and some third parties on which we rely periodically experience cybersecurity incidents. However, as of September 30, 2024, we were not aware of any direct or third-party cybersecurity incidents in the past three fiscal years that have materially affected our business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition.\nInternal and External Testing\nWe proactively manage our cybersecurity risk by continually seeking to identify and mitigate potential cybersecurity threats to and vulnerabilities in our information and technology assets, with both internal and external assessments, as appropriate. For example, public-facing technology assets are subject to both internal security\nassessments and external security researcher testing under our vulnerability disclosure and bug bounty programs. Identified threats and vulnerabilities are required to be remediated within stringent timelines, for which compliance and exceptions are tracked in reporting to management and the board of directors.\nAs further discussed in our risk factors in Item IA of this report, our cybersecurity policies and controls may not be implemented or followed appropriately to mitigate all of our risks. We employ three lines of defense designed to address this risk. The first line of defense consists of the technology teams who develop, build, and deploy our products and services. These teams are trained on and accountable for following our Key Controls. The second line of defense includes separate internal security and risk teams that conduct security assessments of our networks and products, overseeing the remediation of any findings. Finally, our independent internal audit function operates as the third line of defense, assessing the effectiveness of our policies and controls and implementation thereof. We are also subject to regular, detailed examinations by financial regulators and external auditors which often contain a significant cybersecurity component.\nThird-party Risk Management\nWe also apply this same overall framework to our oversight and management of cybersecurity risk from service providers, vendors, suppliers, and other third parties. Our policies require due diligence on our service providers, vendors and suppliers prior to engagement and impose audit rights in our contracts in order to identify cybersecurity risks associated with third-party relationships, proportionate to the inherent risk associated with the products and services provided and the criticality and sensitivity of our information and technology assets to which the third party may have access. As noted in our risk factors in Item IA of this report, our third-party risk management framework may not be implemented effectively or may not be successful or sufficient to mitigate all of our risks. When we become aware that a service provider, vendor, supplier, or other third party has experienced any compromise or failure in the cybersecurity infrastructure owned or controlled by such third party, we may attempt to mitigate our risk, including by terminating such third party’s connection to our information and technology assets where appropriate.\nManagement’s Role and Responsibilities\nOur CISO is responsible for day-to-day management and oversight of our information security program and leads our cybersecurity organization, which comprises approximately 1,000 professionals globally as of September 30, 2024. Our CISO and President of Technology receive regular reports from our cybersecurity personnel in connection with monitoring the prevention, detection, mitigation, and remediation of cybersecurity incidents. Our CISO reports directly to our President of Technology and provides quarterly reports on our cybersecurity performance to the CRC.\nOur current CISO has over 30 years of industry experience leading enterprise cybersecurity teams and enabling secure and scalable ecommerce and payment platforms at multiple Fortune 500 companies. Since joining Visa in November 2015, he has been a core part of building Visa's Zero Trust Architecture and advancing VisaNet's cybersecurity defense capabilities. Our current President of Technology joined Visa in November 2013 and has over 30 years of experience in leading the development and deployment of commerce and transaction technologies, which includes overseeing cybersecurity risk and transformational technology initiatives. At Visa, our President of Technology is responsible for the Company’s technology innovation and investment strategy, product engineering, cybersecurity, global IT, and operations infrastructure, and for accelerating the integration of engineering and product teams.\nBoard Governance\nVisa’s board of directors exercises oversight and control of Visa’s overall enterprise risk management framework and delegates oversight and control of Visa’s cybersecurity program to our audit and risk committee (ARC), which is responsible for ensuring that management has risk-based processes in place designed to assess, identify, and manage cybersecurity risks to which Visa is exposed. As noted in Item 1A, however, these processes may not be sufficient to mitigate all cybersecurity risks. Our CISO provides an update on our cybersecurity program to the ARC twice per year and to the full board of directors annually. The updates to the ARC and the full board of directors provide an overview of our cybersecurity performance, progress against goals, cybersecurity threat landscape, and other relevant developments."

Strong cybersecurity measures reduce the likelihood of disruptive or costly cyber incidents, thereby lowering operational and reputational risks. This risk mitigation contributes to investor confidence as it suggests that the company has robust risk controls in place, which in turn reduces the risk premium that investors might otherwise demand. Additionally, efficient internal processes, regular audits, board-level oversight, and proactive third-party risk assessments can enhance the company’s reputation for reliability and resilience. Over the long term, this can lead to a perception of sustainable growth, lower volatility in earnings, and potentially a pricing premium in the market. Thus, investors are more likely to view Visa as a lower-risk, well-governed entity, which can contribute to a higher market valuation."

      "ground_truth": "The provided financial data allows us to assess Union Pacific's leverage and overall financial risk profile with a focus on debt levels and interest expense trends. Here are the key points:\n\n1. Leverage Measures:\n   • As of December 31, 2023, the company reported current debt (debt due within one year) of $1,423 million and long-term debt (debt due after one year) of $31,156 million, making total debt approximately $32,579 million. \n   • Comparing this to shareholders’ equity for 2023 ($14,788 million) indicates a debt-to-equity ratio of roughly 2.2:1 (i.e., $32,579 million ÷ $14,788 million), suggesting a significant reliance on debt financing. This level of leverage is not unusual in capital-intensive industries such as railroads but does necessitate careful monitoring.\n\n2. Interest Expense and Coverage:\n   • The interest expense in 2023 was $1,340 million, compared to $1,271 million in 2022 and $1,157 million in 2021. Although there is a slight upward trend, the increase in interest expense appears in line with the increases in absolute debt levels.\n   • More importantly, when we look at operating income as a measure to cover interest expenses, the 2023 operating income of $9,082 million results in an interest coverage ratio of roughly 6.8 times (9,082 ÷ 1,340). Historically, in 2022 and 2021 the ratios were around 7.8 and 8.1 respectively, suggesting a marginal tightening but still healthy coverage overall.\n\n3. Financial Risk Profile:\n   • The leverage (substantial long-term debt relative to equity) indicates that Union Pacific has a commitment to fixed debt servicing. However, the strong operating income and consistent interest coverage ratios suggest that the company is well-positioned to manage its debt obligations.\n   • The slight fluctuations in interest expense, when considered alongside stable operating performance, imply that while there is some increase in debt cost, the overall risk remains controlled. The industry standard for capital-intensive sectors is to carry a higher debt load, so Union Pacific’s profile is relatively typical with respect to its sector.\n\nOverall, Union Pacific appears to maintain a high but manageable level of leverage. The company’s ability to cover its interest expenses with robust operating income means that its financial risk profile, while warranting continued monitoring due to the high absolute level of debt, remains acceptable in light of its industry context."

        "Asbestos Matters\n\nThe Company has been named as a defendant in lawsuits alleging personal injury as a result of exposure to asbestos allegedly integrated into certain Carrier products or business premises. While the Company has never manufactured asbestos and no longer incorporates it into any currently-manufactured products, certain products that the Company no longer manufactures contained components incorporating asbestos. A substantial majority of these asbestos-related claims have been dismissed without payment or have been covered in full or in part by insurance or other forms of indemnity. Additional cases were litigated and settled without any insurance reimbursement. The amounts involved in asbestos-related claims were not material individually or in the aggregate in any period. The amounts recorded for asbestos-related liabilities are based on currently available information and assumptions that the Company believes are reasonable and are made with input from outside actuarial experts. These amounts are undiscounted and exclude the Company’s legal fees to defend the asbestos claims, which are expensed as incurred. In addition, the Company has recorded insurance recovery receivables for probable asbestos-related recoveries.\n\nUTC Equity Awards Conversion Litigation\n\nOn August 12, 2020, several former employees of UTC or its subsidiaries filed a putative class action complaint (the \"Complaint\") in the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut against RTX, Carrier, Otis, the former members of the UTC Board of Directors and the members of the Carrier and Otis Boards of Directors (Geraud Darnis, et al. v. Raytheon Technologies Corporation, et al.). The Complaint challenged the method by which UTC equity awards were converted to UTC, Carrier and Otis equity awards following the Separation and the Distribution. Defendants moved to dismiss the Complaint. Plaintiffs amended their Complaint on September 13, 2021 (the \"Amended Complaint\"). The Amended Complaint, with RTX, Carrier and Otis as the only defendants, asserted that the defendants are liable for breach of certain equity compensation plans and for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. The Amended Complaint also sought specific performance. The Company believes all plaintiffs' claims against it are without merit. Defendants moved to dismiss the Amended Complaint. On September 30, 2022, the court dismissed the case against all defendants, with prejudice. Plaintiffs appealed the dismissal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. On August 3, 2023, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the district court's ruling. The Second Circuit’s judgment is final and non-appealable.\n\nAqueous Film Forming Foam Litigation\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company, Kidde-Fenwal, Inc. (\"KFI\") and others have been named as defendants in more than 6,000 lawsuits filed by individuals in or removed to the federal courts of the United States alleging that the historic use of Aqueous Film Forming Foam (\"AFFF\") caused personal injuries and/or property damage. The Company, KFI and others have also been named as defendants in more than 700 lawsuits filed by several U.S. states, municipalities and water utilities in or removed to U.S. federal courts alleging that the historic use of AFFF caused contamination of property and water supplies. In December 2018, the U.S. Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation transferred and consolidated all AFFF cases pending in the U.S. federal courts against the Company, KFI and others to the U.S. District Court for the District of South Carolina (the \"MDL Proceedings\"). The individual plaintiffs in the MDL Proceedings generally seek damages for alleged personal injuries, medical monitoring, diminution in property value and injunctive relief to remediate alleged contamination of water supplies. The U.S.\n state, municipal and water utility plaintiffs in the MDL Proceedings generally seek damages and costs related to the remediation of public property and water supplies.\n\nAFFF is a firefighting foam, developed beginning in the late 1960s pursuant to U.S. military specification, used to extinguish certain types of hydrocarbon-fueled fires. The lawsuits identified above relate to Kidde Fire Fighting, Inc., which owned the National Foam business. Kidde Fire Fighting, Inc. was acquired by a UTC subsidiary in 2005 and merged into KFI in 2007. The National Foam business manufactured AFFF for sale to government (including the U.S. federal government) and non-government customers in the U.S. at a single facility located in West Chester, Pennsylvania (the \"Pennsylvania Site\"). In 2013, KFI divested the AFFF businesses to an unrelated third party. The Company acquired KFI as part of the Separation in April 2020.\n\nThe key components that contribute to AFFF's fire-extinguishing capabilities are known as fluorosurfactants. Neither the Company, nor KFI, nor any of the Company's subsidiaries involved in the AFFF litigation manufactured fluorosurfactants. Instead, the National Foam business purchased these substances from unrelated third parties for use in manufacturing AFFF. Plaintiffs in the MDL Proceedings allege that the fluorosurfactants used by various manufacturers in producing AFFF contained, or over time degraded into, compounds known as per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (referred to collectively as \"PFAS\"), including perflourooctanesulfonic acid (\"PFOS\") and perflourooctanoic acid (\"PFOA\"). Plaintiffs further allege that, as a result of the use of AFFF, PFOS and PFOA were released into the environment and, in some instances, ultimately reached drinking water supplies.\n\nPlaintiffs in the MDL Proceedings allege that PFOS and PFOA contamination has resulted from the use of AFFF manufactured using a process known as ECF, and that this process was used exclusively by 3M. They also allege that PFOA contamination has resulted from the use of AFFF manufactured using a different process, known as telomerization, and that this process was used exclusively by the other AFFF manufacturers (including the National Foam business). Compounds containing PFOS and PFOA (as well as many other PFAS) have also been used for decades by many third parties in a number of different industries to manufacture firefighters’ protective outerwear, carpets, clothing, fabrics, cookware, food packaging, personal care products, cleaning products, paints, varnishes and other consumer and industrial products.\n\nPlaintiffs in the MDL Proceedings have named multiple defendants, including suppliers of chemicals and raw materials used to manufacture fluorosurfactants, fluorosurfactant manufacturers and AFFF manufacturers. The defendants in the MDL Proceedings moved for summary judgment on the government contractor defense, which potentially applies to AFFF sold to or used by the U.S. government. After full briefing and oral argument, on September 16, 2022, the MDL court declined to enter summary judgment for the defendants. The defense, however, remains available at any trial to which it applies.\n\nOn September 23, 2022, after completion of discovery, the MDL court selected one water provider case, the City of Stuart, FL v. 3M, et al., for a bellwether trial. That trial was scheduled to begin in early June 2023 but was postponed indefinitely. The MDL court ordered the bellwether process for personal injury cases to begin in 2023. However, the court has not yet outlined details on that process or its timing.\n\nOutside of the MDL Proceedings, the Company and other defendants are also party to six lawsuits in U.S. state courts brought by oil refining companies alleging product liability claims related to legacy sales of AFFF and seeking damages for the costs to replace the product and for property damage. In addition, the Company and other defendants are party to two actions related to the Pennsylvania Site in which the plaintiff water utility company seeks remediation costs related to the alleged contamination of the local water supply.The Company, KFI and other defendants are also party to one action in Arizona state court brought by a firefighter claiming that occupational exposure to AFFF has caused him certain personal injuries.\n\nThe Company and KFI believe that they have meritorious defenses to the claims in the MDL Proceedings and the other AFFF lawsuits. Given the numerous factual, scientific and legal issues to be resolved relating to these claims, the Company is unable to assess the probability of liability or to reasonably estimate a range of possible loss at this time. There can be no assurance that any such future exposure will not be material in any period.\n\nOn May 14, 2023, KFI filed a voluntary petition with the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware seeking relief under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code after the Company determined that it would not provide financial support to KFI going forward, other than ensuring KFI has access to services necessary for the effective operation of its business. As a result, all litigation against KFI is automatically stayed. KFI filed an adversary complaint and motion in the Chapter 11 case seeking an order staying or enjoining all AFFF-related litigation against the Company, its other subsidiaries and RTX. That motion was resolved through an agreement that effectively stays the AFFF litigation against these parties. KFI has also\nindicated to the bankruptcy court that it intends to pursue insurance coverage for AFFF-related liabilities and contractual indemnification for AFFF-related liabilities from the third party to which KFI sold National Foam. On November 21, 2023, the bankruptcy court ordered certain parties, including the Company, to participate in a mediation with respect to claims that might be asserted by and against it in the bankruptcy proceedings. The parties have engaged in several mediation sessions and anticipate further sessions in the future.\n\nDeconsolidation Due to Bankruptcy\n\nAs of May 14, 2023, the Company no longer controlled KFI as their activities are subject to review and oversight by the bankruptcy court. Therefore, KFI was deconsolidated and their respective assets and liabilities were derecognized from the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements. Upon deconsolidation, the Company determined the fair value of its retained interest in KFI to be zero and accounted for it prospectively using the cost method. As a result of these actions, the Company recognized a loss of $297 million in its Consolidated Statements of Operations within Other income/(expense), net. In addition, the deconsolidation resulted in an investing cash outflow of $134 million in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\n\nIn connection with the bankruptcy filing, KFI entered into several agreements with subsidiaries of the Company to ensure they have access to services necessary for the effective operation of their business. All post-deconsolidation activity between the Company and KFI are reported as third-party transactions recorded within the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations. Since the petition date, there were no material transactions between the Company and KFI.\n\nOther\n\nWe have commitments and contingent liabilities related to legal proceedings, self-insurance programs and matters arising out of the ordinary course of business. Additionally, we are routinely a defendant in, party to or otherwise subject to many pending and threatened legal actions, claims, disputes and proceedings. These matters are often based on alleged violations of contract, product liability, warranty, regulatory, environmental, health and safety, employment, intellectual property, tax and other laws. In some of these proceedings, claims for substantial monetary damages are asserted against us and could result in fines, penalties, compensatory or treble damages or non-monetary relief. We do not believe that these matters will have a material adverse effect upon our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.\n\nA further discussion of our potential regulatory liabilities can be found under the headings \"Business\" and \"Risk Factors\" in this Annual Report."

      "ground_truth": "The available information indicates that the UTC Equity Awards Conversion Litigation was resolved through a dismissal with prejudice, which means that all claims related to it have been finally and non-appealable dismissed. Financially, this resolution did not result in any material cash outlay, significant contingent liability, or other direct financial charges beyond legal expenses expensed as incurred. In other words, there was no recorded monetary loss or settlement amount linked to the litigation that would impact the balance sheet or cash flows directly.\n\nFor Carrier Global Corporation’s equity compensation strategy and capital allocation, the dismissal provides a measure of relief. First, with the litigation closed, the company no longer faces uncertainties or potential future liabilities associated with converting UTC equity awards under the challenged process. This clears a potential source of risk that might have necessitated either retrospective adjustments or ongoing caution in structuring future equity awards. Second, the finality of the dismissal allows the company to focus on optimizing its existing equity compensation practices without the looming threat of similar legal challenges affecting its strategy. As a result, management can more confidently allocate capital—potentially redirecting funds away from legal contingencies towards growth initiatives, shareholder returns, or investments in operational efficiency.\n\nIn summary, the key financial implication was the elimination of an uncertain litigation risk along with its potential associated costs, thereby permitting a more straightforward approach to equity compensation and a cleaner framework for capital allocation going forward."

This consistent, albeit modest, growth could indicate a maturing market where incremental gains are expected, rather than explosive revenue jumps. Investors might interpret these figures as a sign of stable operations but also as an early signal that the potential for large-scale revenue expansion in the U.S. may be becoming more challenging, possibly due to market saturation. Going forward, expectations for future revenue growth may rely more on strategic initiatives such as international expansion, new content investments, or diversified revenue streams to complement this steady U.S. market growth."

      "ground_truth": "To calculate the ratio of research and development (R&D) expense to net revenue for the year 2023, we use the figures from the Consolidated Statements of Income:\n\n• R&D Expense (2023): $16,046 million\n• Net Revenue (2023): $54,228 million \n\nThe ratio is computed as:\n\n  R&D Ratio = R&D Expense / Net Revenue = 16,046 / 54,228 ≈ 0.2955, or about 29.6%\n\nThis relatively high percentage indicates that Intel is investing a significant share of its revenue into R&D. Such an investment can have several long-term implications for Intel’s competitiveness and future growth:\n\n1. Innovation and Product Development: A strong R&D expenditure supports innovation, leading to the development of advanced technologies and products. This can help Intel maintain its technological leadership in an industry where rapid innovation is critical.\n\n2. Competitive Positioning: By investing in R&D, Intel positions itself to stay ahead of competitors. The focus on cutting-edge research and new product development is crucial for capturing market share and responding to evolving industry trends.\n\n3. Future Growth: Continued investment in R&D may facilitate long-term growth through the introduction of next-generation products. This drive for innovation can create new revenue streams and enhance profitability over time.\n\n4. Risk Considerations: While high R&D spending is generally viewed positively for future prospects, it also comes with risks. The effectiveness of R&D investments is contingent upon successful execution and the market acceptance of new products. If the innovations do not meet expectations or if competitors innovate more successfully, the heavy expenditure might not yield the anticipated returns.\n\nOverall, the R&D-to-revenue ratio of approximately 29.6% suggests that Intel is committed to technological innovation, which is expected to bolster its long-term competitiveness and support sustainable growth, provided the investments translate into successful product developments."

      "reference": [
        "We generate cash inflows from operations primarily from selling subscription services which are generally paid in advance of provisioning services, and cash outflows to develop new services and core technologies that further enhance the Now Platform, engage our customer and enhance their experience, and enable and transform our business operations. Subscription services arrangements typically have a three-year duration, and we have experienced a renewal rate of 98% for each of the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021. Cash outflows from operations are principally comprised of the salaries, bonuses, commissions, and benefits for our workforce, licenses and services arrangements that are integral to our business operations and data centers and operating lease arrangements that underlie our facilities. We have generated positive operating cash flows for more than ten years as we continue to grow our business in pursuit of our business strategy, and we expect to grow our business and generate positive cash flows from operations during 2024. When assessing sources of liquidity, we also include cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and long-term investments totaling $8.1 billion as of December 31, 2023.\n\nOur working capital requirements are principally comprised of non-contract workforce salaries, bonuses, commissions, and benefits and, to a lesser extent, cancellable and non-cancellable licenses and services arrangements that are integral to our business operations, and operating lease obligations. Non-cancellable purchase commitments for business operations total $1.6 billion as of December 31, 2023, due primarily over the next five years. Operating lease obligations totaling $937 million are principally associated with leased facilities and have varying maturities with $515 million due over the next five years.\n\nWe may repurchase our shares of common stock in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions or by other means, with the objective to return value to our stockholders and manage the dilution from future employee equity grants and employee stock purchase programs. In May 2023, our board of directors authorized a program to repurchase up to $1.5 billion of our common stock. During the year ended December 31, 2023, we repurchased 0.9 million shares of our common stock for $538 million. All repurchases were made in open market transactions. Repurchases of common stock are recognized as treasury stock and held for future issuance. As of December 31, 2023, $962 million of the originally authorized amount under the Share Repurchase Program remained available for future repurchases.\n\nTo grow our business, we also invest in capital and other resources to expand our data centers and enable our workforce, and we acquire technology and businesses to supplement our technology portfolio. Our capital expenditures are typically under cancellable arrangements primarily used to support the installed base and growth of our hosted business. We have also issued long-term debt to finance our business. In August 2020, we issued 1.40% fixed rate ten-year notes with an aggregate principal amount of $1.5 billion due on September 1, 2030 (the “2030 Notes”).\n\nOur free cash flows, together with our other sources of liquidity, are available to service our liabilities as well as our cancellable and non-cancellable arrangements. We anticipate cash flows generated from operations, cash, cash equivalents and investments will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs for at least the next 12 months. As we look beyond the next 12 months, we seek to continue to grow free cash flows necessary to fund our operations and grow our business. If we require additional capital resources, we may seek to finance our operations from the current funds available or additional equity or debt financing.\n \tYear Ended December 31,\n \t2023\t\t2022\n \t\n(in millions)\nNet cash provided by operating activities\t$\t3,398 \t\t\t$\t2,723 \t\nNet cash used in investing activities\t(2,167)\t\t\t(2,583)\t\nNet cash used in financing activities\t(803)\t\t\t(344)\t\nNet increase/(decrease) in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash\n429 \t\t\t(257)",
        "Net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $2.2 billion compared to $2.6 billion for the prior year. The net decrease in cash used in investing activities was primarily due to a $681 million decrease in net purchases of investments, a $92 million decrease in purchases of non-marketable investments, offset by a $191 million increase in business combinations and a $144 million increase in purchases of property and equipment."

This improvement indicates that the company has enhanced its operational efficiency, as it is generating more cash from its core operations.

      "ground_truth": "The available contractual obligations data provide insight into Schwab’s near‐and long‐term cash outflow schedule. Specifically, the company has $537 million in short-term purchase obligations versus $439 million in long-term obligations. This indicates that a significant portion of cash outflows is expected in the near term, which will require careful liquidity management to meet these obligations without impairing operational flexibility. In addition, these obligations—spanning payments on brokered CDs, debt instruments, and various purchase commitments—can have several implications:\n\n1. Future Cash Flow Needs: The large short-term obligations suggest that Schwab will face considerable cash outflows in the immediate future. Management may need to secure or reserve sufficient liquidity or adjust financing arrangements to ensure that these short-term liabilities are met without stressing cash flows. In the longer term, the obligations of $439 million are scheduled further out, allowing for potential planning through refinancing or structured capital management.\n\n2. Competitive Positioning: Maintaining sufficient liquidity and capital resources to honor these contractual commitments is crucial. If Schwab can manage these obligations effectively, it can continue to invest in its client services and technological capabilities—areas that enhance competitive positioning. Conversely, if liquidity pressures arise, there might be less flexibility to deploy capital in strategic areas such as marketing, innovation, or expansion—all of which influence competitive advantage.\n\n3. Growth Prospects: The structured nature of these obligations provides predictability in cash outflow timing. With proper capital allocation, Schwab can mitigate risks by aligning cash flows with revenue-generating activities. This proactive management could support growth initiatives. However, if the near‐term obligations limit cash availability, it might necessitate conservative growth or delay certain investments that drive expansion.\n\nOverall, while the obligation timelines underscore a near-term cash flow challenge, they also reflect planned, structured liabilities. With strong liquidity and strategic capital management, Schwab is positioned to manage these obligations while sustaining competitive positioning and pursuing growth opportunities."

      "reference": [
        "As a global leader in animal health, we are reliant on complex information systems and digital solutions that make us inherently vulnerable to malicious cyber intrusion and attack. In addition, we have been expanding our data and digital capabilities including in our diagnostics portfolio, and as a result, there could be an increased likelihood of a cyberattack or breach of security that could negatively impact us or our customers. Despite the presence of these risks, to date, the identified risks of cybersecurity threats (including as a result of any previous cybersecurity incidents) have not materially affected, and are not reasonably likely to materially affect, us or our business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition. For a description of the risks from cybersecurity threats that may materially affect us and how they may do so, see our risk factors under Part 1. Item 1A. Risk Factors in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nCybersecurity Program\nAs part of our risk management processes, we have an enterprise-wide cybersecurity program aligned to the NIST Cybersecurity Framework. Our program is a risk-based program designed to protect our information systems through multiple defenses and layers of security, commonly referred to as a “Defense in Depth” approach. Key elements of our program include:\nIndependent Third-Party Assessments\nWe engage an independent third party to conduct assessments of our cybersecurity program approximately every 18 months. This independent third-party assessment includes an evaluation of our cybersecurity controls based on the NIST Cybersecurity Framework.\nTraining\nWe have an information security training program that includes: monthly awareness articles, a phishing training program (with reports reviewed by the Executive Team), a Security Ambassador program for additional training and awareness for individuals in high risk roles, required and optional training modules in our Learning Management System, and quarterly security-focused podcasts.\nIncident Response Procedure\nWe have a 24/7 managed Security Operations Center (SOC) for escalation of any critical events, including cybersecurity incidents. In the event of an incident, we use an Incident Response procedure leveraging NIST Standard 800-61 standards that we have customized for Zoetis. Additionally, we have in place disaster recovery and business continuity practices designed to provide for continuous business operations for our customers in the event of a cybersecurity incident. While we maintain cybersecurity insurance, the costs related to cybersecurity threats or disruptions may not be fully insured.\nThird Party Onboarding\nWe depend on third parties and applications on virtualized (cloud) infrastructure to operate and support our information systems and have a third-party risk management program and assessment process for onboarding third parties.\nManagement’s Role in Risk Oversight\nOur information security team includes our Executive Vice President, Chief Digital & Technology Officer; our Vice President, Chief Information Officer; and our Head of Technology Risk, Compliance and Chief Information Security Officer. Our Executive Vice President, Chief Digital and Technology Officer has over 20 years of information technology experience. She was the Chief Information Officer for key business units at an S&P 500 healthcare company, and was that company’s first Chief Information Security Officer, where she led the strategy and execution to secure products, devices, manufacturing systems and information across businesses. She holds a master’s degree in computer science and a master’s degree in business applications of information and technology. Our Vice President, Chief Information Officer has over 20 years of experience in technology and digital leadership roles at large public companies and holds a bachelor’s degree in information systems. Our Head of Technology Risk, Compliance and Chief Information Security Officer has over 20 years of experience in information security, and holds a bachelor’s degrees in computer science and biology.\nWe have established a cybersecurity governance program with clear roles for the executive management team as well as oversight by the Board of Directors and the Audit Committee. The Zoetis information security team provides regular cyber threat intelligence briefings to management and provides updates to our senior executives on the status of the Company’s security measures and our efforts to identify and mitigate risks from cybersecurity threats. The Zoetis information security team also works closely with the Zoetis Legal team, including the Chief Privacy Officer, to further enhance incident response procedures. For example, we have a corporate crisis management plan in place to govern our response to corporate crises, which could include cyber incidents, and we conduct periodic simulated programs to ensure readiness. This plan also includes a standard framework for categorization of incidents based on risk level and severity, and requires escalation to Zoetis senior management and/or the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors if certain severity levels are met.\nRole of the Board of Directors and Committees\nThe Board of Directors maintains an active role in the oversight of material risks. The Board of Directors utilizes its various Committees to oversee certain key risks, and has delegated responsibility to the Audit Committee for oversight of the Company’s enterprise risk management process and information security risk management program. Management, with oversight from the Zoetis Board of Directors, is responsible for the Company’s assessment and management of exposure to risk. The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors is also responsible for oversight of compliance with disclosure requirements under applicable laws and regulations, and would be consulted prior to the disclosure of any material cybersecurity incident.\nThe Zoetis information security team regularly provides an information security dashboard to the Audit Committee, covering the most active and relevant threats to Zoetis, relevant trends, and any notable events. At least twice annually, the Zoetis information security team presents updates to the Audit Committee with respect to the information security program, including the status of our security measures and our efforts to identify and mitigate information security risks. The Audit Committee also regularly reviews certain data privacy and cybersecurity metrics as part of the compliance update presented to the Audit Committee. In addition, the Chief Information Security Officer presents updates at least annually to the Board of Directors with respect to the information security program, including the results of our independent, third-party assessment. The Board of Directors also participates in annual table-top exercises involving simulated data security incidents and the Company’s responses to those incidents."

      "ground_truth": "The provided information allows for a qualitative assessment of the potential valuation impact resulting from Zoetis Inc.'s ongoing cybersecurity initiatives. Although we cannot derive an exact quantitative adjustment from the cybersecurity training, awareness programs, and risk assessment measures, we can highlight several key points:\n\n1. Risk Mitigation and Economic Value: Robust cybersecurity measures reduce the likelihood and potential impact of data breaches and other security incidents. This mitigation can translate into a lower overall risk profile, which may result in a lower cost of capital and a smaller risk premium reflected in the company’s valuation models compared to peers with less comprehensive programs.\n\n2. Competitive Positioning: Zoetis’s proactive stance—with regular independent third-party assessments, comprehensive training, and a clear incident response framework—can provide a competitive advantage within the animal health and diagnostics sectors. Investors might view these efforts as enhancing business continuity and protecting intellectual property, which is critical in a technology-driven environment. This could lead to a premium valuation relative to peers if Zoetis’s risk management is viewed as superior.\n\n3. Qualitative Versus Quantitative Impact: While the qualitative benefits are clear, quantifying the exact influence on valuation (for example, via adjustments to discount rates or risk premiums) requires additional financial data and comparable metrics from industry peers. Typically, these measures would be reflected in the discount rates derived during a discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis. A company with a robust cybersecurity program might enjoy a slightly lower discount rate because of reduced risk exposure, thereby boosting its present valuation relative to companies that face higher cybersecurity risks.\n\n4. Peer Comparison: If peers in the animal health and diagnostics sectors have less advanced cybersecurity protocols, Zoetis’s enhanced programs may make it a more attractive investment. Investors often penalize companies for operational risks, so reducing these risks can be seen as a positive differentiator.\n\nIn summary, while it is difficult to attach a specific numerical ‘value’ to these cybersecurity efforts without further financial data and market analysis, the qualitative influence is likely to be a positive one. Investors might assign a valuation premium to Zoetis relative to its peers due to its lower risk profile, greater operational resilience, and proactive approach to managing cybersecurity threats."

        "We enter into contracts with customers that may include combinations of products and services, resulting in arrangements containing multiple performance obligations for hardware and software products and/or various services.\nThe majority of our revenue is derived from sales of products and services and the associated support and maintenance, and such revenue is recognized when, or as, control of promised products or services is transferred to the customer at the transaction price. Transaction price is adjusted for variable consideration which may be offered in contracts with customers, partners, and distributors and may include rebates, volume-based discounts, price protection, and other incentive programs.\nSignificant judgment is applied in determining the transaction price as we may be required to estimate variable consideration at the time of revenue recognition. When determining the amount of revenue to recognize, we estimate the expected usage of these programs, applying the expected value or most likely estimate and update the estimate at each reporting period as actual utilization becomes available. Variable consideration is recognized only to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal of revenue will not occur. We also consider the customers' right of return in determining the transaction price, where applicable.\nTo recognize revenue for the products and services for which control has been transferred, we allocate the transaction price for the contract among the performance obligations on a relative standalone selling price (“SSP”) basis. For products and services sold as a bundle, the SSP is generally not directly observable and requires the Company to estimate SSP based on management judgment by considering available data such as internal margin objectives, pricing strategies, market/competitive conditions, historical profitability data, as well as other observable inputs. For certain products and services, the Company establishes SSP based on the observable price when sold separately in similar circumstances to similar customers. The Company establishes SSP ranges for its products and services and reassesses them periodically."

      "ground_truth": "The use of significant judgment in determining variable consideration and estimating the Standalone Selling Price (SSP) for bundled contracts means that revenue recognition is dependent on several subjective estimates and assumptions. First, when the company estimates variable consideration (such as rebates, discounts, or incentive programs), inaccuracies in forecasting customer behavior – such as actual usage of discounts or returns – may lead to reversals or adjustments in recognized revenue. This can introduce volatility and uncertainty into reported revenues, which affects perceived revenue stability. Second, estimating the SSP without directly observable prices involves management judgment, where assumptions about market conditions, competitive pricing, historical profitability, and internal margin objectives come into play. If these assumptions are overly optimistic or misaligned with market realities, the allocated transaction prices among performance obligations might not fully reflect actual economic values, thereby impacting revenue growth rates. In summary, while such judgments allow flexibility to tailor revenue recognition to business realities, they can also create risks relating to revenue timing, amount recognition, and potential for future adjustments – all of which are influential factors for both revenue stability and growth potential for the company."

        "Premiums on property and casualty insurance contracts are recognized in proportion to the underlying risk insured and are primarily earned ratably over the term of the policies. Premiums on long-term care contracts are earned ratably over the policy year in which they are due. The reserve for unearned premiums represents the portion of premiums written relating to the unexpired terms of coverage.\n\nProperty and casualty contracts that are retrospectively rated or subject to audit premiums contain provisions that result in an adjustment to the initial policy premium depending on the contract provisions. These provisions stipulate the adjustment due to loss experience of the insured during the coverage period, or changes in the level of exposure to insurance risk. For such contracts, CNA estimates the amount of ultimate premiums that it may earn upon completion of the coverage period and recognizes either an asset or a liability for the difference between the initial policy premium and the estimated ultimate premium. CNA either adjusts such estimated ultimate premium amounts during the course of the coverage period based on actual results to date or by conducting premium audits after the policy has expired to determine the final exposure to insured risks. The resulting adjustment is recorded as either a reduction of or an increase to the earned premiums for the period.\n\nInsurance receivables include balances due currently or in the future, including amounts due from insureds related to paid losses under high deductible policies, and are presented at unpaid balances, net of an allowance for doubtful accounts. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, an allowance for doubtful accounts of $28 million and $29 million for insurance receivables has been established using a loss rate methodology to determine expected credit losses for premium receivables. This methodology uses CNA’s historical annual credit losses relative to gross premium written to develop a range of credit loss rates for each dollar of gross written premium underwritten. Additionally, an expected credit loss for amounts due from insureds under high deductible and retrospectively rated policies is calculated on a pool basis, informed by historical default rate data obtained from major rating agencies. Changes in the allowance are presented as a component of Other operating expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Amounts are considered past due based on policy payment terms. Insurance receivables and any related allowance are written off after collection efforts are exhausted or a negotiated settlement is reached.\n\nCNA’s non-insurance warranty revenues are primarily generated from separately-priced service contracts that provide mechanical breakdown and other coverages to vehicle or consumer goods owners, which generally provide coverage from one month to ten years. For warranty products where CNA acts as the principal in the transaction, Non-insurance warranty revenue is reported on a gross basis, with amounts paid by customers reported as Non-insurance warranty revenue and commissions paid to agents and dealers reported as Non-insurance warranty expense on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Additionally, CNA provides warranty administration services for dealer and manufacturer warranty products. Non-insurance revenues are recognized when obligations under the terms of the contract with CNA’s customers are satisfied, which is generally over time as obligations are fulfilled. CNA recognizes non-insurance warranty revenue over the service period in proportion to the actuarially determined expected claims emergence pattern. Customers predominantly pay in full at the inception of the warranty contract. The liability for unearned warranty revenue, reported as Deferred non-insurance warranty revenue on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, represents the unearned portion of revenue in advance of CNA’s performance, including amounts which are refundable upon cancellation.\n\nContract costs to obtain or fulfill non-insurance warranty contracts with customers are deferred and recorded as Deferred non-insurance warranty acquisition expenses on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. These costs are expected to be recoverable over the term of the contract and are amortized in the same manner the related revenue is recognized. CNA evaluates deferred costs for recoverability including consideration of anticipated investment income. Adjustments to deferred costs, if necessary, are recorded in the current period results of operations.\n\nBoardwalk Pipelines primarily earns revenues by providing transportation and storage services for natural gas and natural gas liquids and other hydrocarbons (referred to together as “NGLs”) on a firm and interruptible basis and providing ethane supply and transportation services for industrial customers in Louisiana and Texas. Boardwalk Pipelines also provides interruptible natural gas parking and lending services. The majority of Boardwalk Pipelines’ operating subsidiaries are subject to Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (“FERC”) regulations and certain revenues collected, under certain circumstances, may be subject to possible refunds to its customers. An estimated refund liability is recorded considering regulatory proceedings, advice of counsel and estimated total exposure. The majority of Boardwalk Pipelines’ revenues are from firm service contracts which are accounted for as a single promise to stand ready each month of the contract term to provide the committed capacity for either transportation or storage services. The transaction price is comprised of a fixed fee based on the capacity reserved plus a usage fee paid on the volume of commodity transported or injected and withdrawn from storage. Both the fixed and the usage fees are allocated to the single performance obligation of providing transportation or storage service and recognized over time as control is passed to the customer. These service contracts can range in term from one to 20 years and are invoiced monthly. For the ethane supply contracts, the purchases and sales are with different counterparties and control transfers at different receipt and delivery points, resulting in the purchases and sales being presented on a gross basis in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\n\nLoews Hotels & Co provides lodging and related goods and services as well as management and marketing services. Lodging and related revenues are recognized as the guest takes possession of the goods or receives the services. Management and marketing services revenues are recognized as the services are provided and billed on a monthly basis. In addition, Loews Hotels & Co recognizes revenue for the reimbursement of payroll and other expenses as they are incurred on behalf of the owners of joint venture and managed hotel properties.\n\nAltium Packaging is a packaging solutions provider and manufacturer in North America, serving a diverse customer base in the pharmaceutical, dairy, household chemicals, food/nutraceuticals, industrial/specialty chemicals, water and beverage/juice segments. Altium Packaging recognizes revenue when obligations under the terms of a contract with a customer have been satisfied. This occurs at the time control is transferred to the customer, which generally occurs upon delivery or completion of the manufacturing process."

Although the timing and manner in which revenue is recognized differ—lodging revenues are recognized as a guest takes possession of goods/services, while management and marketing services revenues are recorded as the services are provided and billed—the company uses the underlying standard framework to ensure consistency and comparability. Key measures include:\n\n1. Uniform application of ASC 606 principles: Both revenue streams are evaluated based on the identification of distinct performance obligations, the allocation of transaction prices to these obligations, and the timing of control transfer. This ensures that, even if the recognition patterns differ according to the nature of the services, the underlying measurement and disclosure criteria remain comparable.\n\n2. Standardization of recognition criteria: For lodging revenue, recognition occurs when the guest receives the service. For management and marketing services, revenue recognition aligns with the delivery of services over time. This systematic approach, calibrated to the specific timing of service delivery, is consistently applied across periods.\n\n3. Detailed disclosures and reconciliations: Loews Corporation discloses the methods used for revenue recognition in its financial statements. This transparency, supported by independent audits and regulatory reviews, helps maintain consistency in how revenues are reported and compared over time.\n\n4. Integrated financial reporting systems: By using centralized processes to capture and reconcile revenue data from different segments, Loews ensures that all revenue is recorded in accordance with the same overall accounting policies, aiding comparability across transaction types.\n\nThrough these measures, Loews Corporation aligns its dual revenue recognition methods within a common GAAP framework, ensuring that the resulting financial reports are both consistent and comparable despite the inherent differences in timing and method of revenue receipt."

      "ground_truth": "The provided information allows us to analyze how Fortinet’s integrated product lines support recurring revenues and enhance cash flow stability. Fortinet has built an ecosystem that spans secure networking, unified SASE, and security operations (SecOps), along with ancillary training and support services. This integration contributes to recurring revenues and cash flow stability in several ways:\n\n1. Subscription-Based Services and Support: Many of Fortinet’s offerings, particularly the secure networking solutions and the unified SASE platform, are delivered as subscriptions (via cloud, on-premises, or SaaS models). Additionally, services such as FortiCare technical support and FortiGuard security services are structured on recurring fee models. The recurring revenue from these ongoing contracts and support services helps to stabilize cash flows over time.\n\n2. Cross-Selling and Upsell Opportunities: By integrating multiple product lines into a cohesive security fabric, Fortinet creates an environment where customers are encouraged to adopt a suite of interconnected solutions. A customer initially purchasing a network firewall may also be incentivized to invest in SecOps solutions, software updates, training programs, and continued support services. This multi-product approach not only deepens customer relationships but also increases the lifetime value of each customer through repeated, recurring transactions.\n\n3. Diversification of Revenue Streams: The combination of hardware sales, subscription services, and training certifications diversifies Fortinet’s revenue base. Even if one product category experiences volatility in a given period, the continual inflow of subscription and support fees can help mitigate the impact, thus contributing to overall cash flow stability.\n\n4.

        "BD operates in the increasingly complex and challenging medical technology marketplace. Technological advances and scientific discoveries have accelerated the pace of change in medical technology, the regulatory environment of medical products is becoming more complex and vigorous, and economic conditions have resulted in a challenging market. Companies of varying sizes compete in the global medical technology field. Some are more specialized than BD with respect to particular markets, and some have greater financial resources than BD. New companies have entered the field, particularly in the areas of molecular diagnostics, non-traditional point of care and at-home testing, safety-engineered devices and in the life sciences. Additionally, established companies have diversified their business activities into the medical technology area. Other firms engaged in the distribution of medical technology products have become manufacturers of medical devices and instruments as well. Acquisitions and collaborations by and among companies seeking a competitive advantage also affect the competitive environment. In addition, the entry into the market of low-\ncost manufacturers has created increased pricing pressures. BD competes in this evolving marketplace on the basis of many factors, including price, quality, innovation, service, reputation, distribution and promotion. The impact of these factors on BD’s competitive position varies among BD’s various product offerings. In order to remain competitive in the industries in which it operates and to boost supply reliability and productivity, BD continues to make investments in R&D, quality management, quality improvement, product innovation, manufacturing and supply chain.

Specifically, BD operates in a highly competitive environment where its market position is challenged by:\n\n1. Vigorous and complex competition: BD faces competition from both established companies and new entrants. Competitors vary in specialization, financial resources, and technological expertise, which can lead to pricing pressures, particularly from low-cost manufacturers entering the market.\n\n2. Rapid technological change: Advances in medical technology and scientific discoveries require continuous investment in R&D, quality management, and supply chain improvements. This creates a pressure to stay ahead technologically while managing the costs associated with innovation and regulatory compliance.\n\nThese risks may influence BD’s long-term financial health by compressing margins due to increased competition and higher cost structures from necessary capital expenditure in R&D and advanced manufacturing. Strategically, BD is countering these risks by investing significantly in product innovation, quality improvement, and supply chain robustness to maintain competitive differentiation, sustain market share, and secure future growth opportunities, even if these investments might weigh on short-term financial metrics. Overall, while the competitive and technological landscapes increase inherent risks, the proactive strategic investments made by BD are designed to mitigate these risks and ensure long-term success."

      "ground_truth": "Rollins, Inc.'s shift in investing activities between 2022 and 2023 reflects a deliberate change in its strategic priorities. The data shows that net investing outflows increased substantially from $134.1 million in 2022 to $372.9 million in 2023. A key driver of this change was the marked increase in cash paid for acquisitions, which jumped from $119.2 million in 2022 to $366.9 million in 2023. This spike, primarily due to the acquisition of Fox Pest Control, indicates that the company is aggressively pursuing growth through acquisitions to expand its service offerings and market presence. \n\nIn addition, while capital expenditures in 2023 were slightly higher ($32.5 million vs. $30.6 million in 2022), the impact of these expenditures appears to be moderated by the receipt of cash proceeds from asset and business sales. This suggests that Rollins is maintaining a balanced approach by reinvesting in its operational capabilities while also leveraging divestitures to help offset some of the cash outflows from acquisitions. \n\nOverall, these changes in capital allocation point to a strategic emphasis on long-term growth through organic expansion bolstered by targeted acquisitions. The use of multiple funding sources—existing cash, operating cash flows, and borrowings—further underscores the company's commitment to investing in its competitive positioning, despite the increased short-term cash outflows and potential integration risks. This strategic realignment is consistent with a focus on strengthening market leadership and pursuing sustainable long-term growth."

Johnson, Jr.—suggests a continuity in leadership with deep, cross-functional expertise and long tenure at Franklin Resources, Inc. Their extensive experience across various executive roles reinforces strong governance and an intimate understanding of the company’s strategic objectives. In qualitative terms, such stable and experienced leadership has likely contributed to sound decision-making in areas such as capital allocation, risk management, and operational efficiency, all of which are critical to long‐term financial health and profitability. For example, their long-term strategic oversight would support disciplined reinvestment strategies and effective cost controls, which can help maintain steady margins and improve returns over time.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that while the biographical data paints a picture of robust leadership, the provided information does not include specific financial metrics (like profit margins, return on equity, or cash flow statements) that would allow us to quantify the direct impact of their leadership on the company’s financial performance. Therefore, the answer draws on established finance theory regarding the positive implications of experienced, stable management rather than on detailed numerical analysis. In summary, the leadership of these individuals is widely considered an asset to the long-term financial stability and profitability of the company, even though direct calculations from the given data are not feasible."

        "Revenue from contracts with customers primarily consists of casino wagers, room sales, food and beverage transactions, rental income from the Company’s mall tenants, convention sales and entertainment and ferry ticket sales. These contracts can be written, oral or implied by customary business practices.\nGross casino revenue is the aggregate of gaming wins and losses. The commissions rebated to gaming promoters and premium players for rolling play, cash discounts and other cash incentives to patrons related to gaming play are recorded as a reduction to gross casino revenue. Gaming contracts include a performance obligation to honor the patron’s wager and typically include a performance obligation to provide a product or service to the patron on a complimentary basis to incentivize gaming or in exchange for points earned under the Company’s loyalty programs.\nFor wagering contracts that include complimentary products and services provided by the Company to incentivize gaming, the Company allocates the relative stand-alone selling price of each product and service to the respective revenue type. Complimentary products or services provided under the Company's control and discretion, which are supplied by third parties, are recorded as an operating expense.\nFor wagering contracts that include products and services provided to a patron in exchange for points earned under the Company’s loyalty programs, the Company allocates the estimated fair value of the points earned to the loyalty program liability. The loyalty program liability is a deferral of revenue until redemption occurs. Upon redemption of loyalty program points for Company-owned products and services, the stand-alone selling price of each product or service is allocated to the respective revenue type. For redemptions of points with third parties, the redemption amount is deducted from the loyalty program liability and paid directly to the third party. Any discounts received by the Company from the third party in connection with this transaction are recorded to other revenue.\nAfter allocation to the other revenue types for products and services provided to patrons as part of a wagering contract, the residual amount is recorded to casino revenue as soon as the wager is settled. As all wagers have similar characteristics, the Company accounts for its gaming contracts collectively on a portfolio basis versus an individual basis.\nHotel revenue recognition criteria are met at the time of occupancy. Food and beverage revenue recognition criteria are met at the time of service. Convention revenues are recognized when the related service is rendered or the event is held. Deposits for future hotel occupancy, convention space or food and beverage services contracts are recorded as deferred revenue until the revenue recognition criteria are met. Cancellation fees for convention contracts are recognized upon cancellation by the customer and are included in other revenues. Ferry and entertainment revenue recognition criteria are met at the completion of the ferry trip or event, respectively. Revenue from contracts with a combination of these services is allocated pro rata based on each service’s relative stand-alone selling price.\nRevenue from leases is primarily recorded to mall revenue and is generated from base rents and overage rents received through long-term leases with retail tenants. Base rent, adjusted for contractual escalations, is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the related lease. Overage rent is paid by a tenant when its sales exceed an agreed upon minimum amount and is not recognized by the Company until the threshold is met."

      "ground_truth": "The key impact is that by allocating revenue based on the stand-alone selling prices, the casino is effectively breaking down a bundled wagering contract into separate performance obligations. In the case of casino wagers that include complimentary products and services:\n\n1. The Company first assigns a portion of the transaction price to the complimentary products and services, based on their individual stand-alone selling prices. This means that a part of what might appear to be casino gaming revenue is, in fact, attributable to the other services.\n\n2. The residual amount—what remains after the allocations—is recognized as casino revenue at the time the wager is settled. This has the effect of reducing the immediate revenue recognized as being directly from gaming activities.\n\n3. In timing terms, revenue recognition is tied to when each performance obligation is fulfilled. For example, while gaming revenue (after allocation) is recognized on settlement of the wager, revenue for complimentary services may be recognized either at the time of service (if delivered by Las Vegas Sands) or recorded differently if supplied by third parties (often as an operating expense or deferred until fulfillment conditions are met).\n\nOverall, this allocation method ensures that revenue is recognized in a manner that accurately reflects the delivery of each service. It both impacts the amount of revenue recorded for casino wagers (by reducing it via the allocation of the complementary items) and impacts the timing, as the complementary products or services might be provided later, leading to deferred revenue recognition for those parts."

In 2024 the reported total non‐operating expense (which is the sum of interest expense and other non‐operating items) was $133.3 million (in thousands), compared with $110.8 million in 2023 and $111.0 million in 2022. (Note: The 2022 figure includes a fair‐value adjustment which is not present in 2024.)\n\nA straightforward way to gauge the impact is to determine by how much the non‐operating expense represents an “extra” drag on margins in 2024 relative to the prior years. Using the 2024 total revenues of about $5,138.7 million as the base:\n\n• In 2024, non‐operating expenses as a percentage of revenue = 133,308/5,138,701 ≈ 2.59%\n• In 2023, the percentage = 110,835/4,536,266 ≈ 2.44%\n• In 2022, the percentage = 111,012/4,223,403 ≈ 2.63%\n\nThus, relative to 2023, the non‐operating expense in 2024 was higher by about $22,473 thousand. Expressed on a revenue basis for 2024, that extra expense is approximately:\n\n  22,473/5,138,701 ≈ 0.44 percentage points.\n\nIn other words, if we “normalized” the non‐operating line to the 2023 level, we could expect the net income margin (which is calculated after subtracting such expenses) to be higher by roughly 0.44 percentage points. (The comparison with 2022 is very similar; 2024 is lower by about 0.04 percentage points relative to 2022, but note that the nature of the non‐operating adjustments is different because of the fair‐value item in 2022.)\n\nA closer look at the components shows that interest expense in 2024 increased to $144.35 million from $107.96 million in 2023 – an increase of roughly $36.4 million. However, a partly offsetting item is the “interest and miscellaneous (income) expense,” which was –$11.04 million in 2024 (a benefit), compared with a positive $2.88 million expense in 2023. When combined, the net effect is about an extra expense of $22.5 million in 2024 compared to 2023. Dividing this amount by total revenue gives the approximate added drag on margins of ~0.44 percentage points.\n\nTherefore, the contribution of the increased non‐operating expense (primarily driven by higher interest expense partially offset by the reversal of a prior expense item) is roughly 0.44 percentage points of revenue, which is the part of the net income margin reduction attributable solely to these items when comparing 2024 to 2023."

      "ground_truth": "The provided data, which lists board members’ ages between 49 and 57 along with their roles, allows us to infer how a relatively narrow age range might influence strategic planning and operational agility. Although the age spread is modest, the board comprises executives in key functions—CEO, CFO, technical, legal, and business unit leaders—which suggests a blend of extensive experience and a range of perspectives. Here are the key insights:\n\n1. Strategic Maturity and Stability: With ages clustering in the late 40s to late 50s, these leaders are likely to have built strong professional networks and accumulated decades of industry expertise. This experience can foster a conservative approach to risk in long-term strategic planning, ensuring that initiatives are well-considered and grounded in historical context and market cycles.\n\n2. Balanced Decision-Making: The diversity in functional roles combined with similar life-stage experiences implies that the board can leverage a shared strategic vision while still benefiting from varied insights. The board’s composite background—spanning finance, technical operations, legal affairs, and regional leadership—facilitates a holistic view of the firm's challenges and opportunities.\n\n3. Operational Agility: While seasoned executives bring stability, there might be a trade-off when it comes to rapid adaptation. To maintain operational agility, the board may rely on a combination of their deep experience and input from younger, possibly more tech-oriented team members lower in the organizational hierarchy. This collaboration can enhance the firm’s responsiveness to disruptive technologies and evolving market dynamics.\n\n4. Generational Perspective: Although the age range isn’t very broad, even a slight variation in generational outlook (for instance, differing comfort levels with digital transformation and emerging business models) can influence the prioritization of innovation versus risk aversion. The board’s composition may promote a prudent, yet innovative approach to long-term planning while ensuring that operational decisions remain flexible.\n\nIn summary, the collection of executives, all in a similarly mature phase of their careers, likely brings both depth and a measure of diversity in thought processes to Generac Holdings Inc.'s strategic planning. Their collective experience underpins stability and well-informed decision-making, which, when complemented by input from a broader organizational talent pool, can bolster both sustained growth and agility in operations."

      "ground_truth": "Marriott’s balance sheet indicates that its long-term debt increased from approximately $9,380 million in 2022 to about $11,320 million in 2023 – roughly a 20% increase. This rise in leverage suggests that the company is actively using debt financing to support its strategic operations and possibly to fund expansion, acquisitions, or other capital investments. Key observations include:\n\n1. **Leverage Management** – While total long-term debt increased significantly, the current portion of long-term debt actually declined from $684 million in 2022 to $553 million in 2023. This may indicate that Marriott is refinancing its borrowings to extend maturities, thereby reducing near-term repayment pressure and stabilizing its liquidity position. This approach can be seen as managing its leverage by structuring the debt profile in a way that mitigates short-term risk.\n\n2. **Implications for Risk Profile** – An increase in debt levels naturally elevates financial leverage, which can intensify the impact of business fluctuations on earnings. Higher debt may expose Marriott to increased financial risk, particularly during downturns or if operating income is pressured. However, a well-planned refinancing (as indicated by the lower current portions) can help manage liquidity risks. The company’s strong operating income (with operating income rising from $3,462 million in 2022 to $3,864 million in 2023) supports its ability to service enhanced debt levels, though the higher interest expense (rising from $403 million to $565 million) is a signal of the increasing cost of borrowing that should be monitored closely.\n\n3. **Cost of Capital Considerations** – Increased leverage can lead to a higher weighted-average cost of capital (WACC) if lenders and investors perceive the company as carrying more risk. In future periods, if the debt levels remain high or continue to expand, Marriott might face higher interest rates on new borrowings or refinancing. However, if the company is successful in leveraging this debt to generate higher returns than the cost of debt, the financial strategy could be value-enhancing for shareholders.\n\nOverall, the balance sheet data suggest that Marriott is deliberately managing its debt profile to support strategic initiatives while attempting to structure maturities to reduce short-term liquidity risks. The tradeoff is an elevated risk profile and potential increase in its cost of capital, which investors should monitor, particularly in changing market conditions or economic downturns."

Over the next five fiscal years (2025–2029), Tyson Foods, Inc. has maturities totaling approximately $5.454 billion, broken down as follows:\n\n• 2025: $75 million\n• 2026: $1,594 million\n• 2027: $1,381 million\n• 2028: $791 million\n• 2029: $1,613 million\n\nKey insights include:\n\n1. Liquidity Pressure – The large amounts due, especially in 2026, 2027, and 2029, could exert a material cash outflow requirement. If the company’s operating cash flow or available liquid assets are insufficient in those periods, it may need to allocate cash that would otherwise support operations or invest in growth initiatives. This concentration of maturities indicates that while the 2025 maturity is relatively small and likely manageable, the majority of the debt maturity schedule will require careful liquidity management.\n\n2. Refinancing Risk – With nearly $1.6 billion due in both 2026 and 2029, as well as significant amounts in 2027 and 2028, Tyson Foods faces considerable refinancing risk. If market conditions are unfavorable or if the company's credit profile is perceived as weaker at the time of refinancing, it might have to refinance at higher interest rates or under less favorable terms. In addition, the need to secure refinancing for such amounts may also stress the balance sheet and could negatively influence the company's borrowing costs and credit ratings, especially if earnings do not grow in line with these repayment obligations.\n\nIn summary, while the scheduled debt maturities provide a clear calendar of obligations, their size and timing suggest that liquidity management and successful refinancing will be critical. The company will need to ensure robust cash flow generation or maintain favorable market conditions to mitigate the risks associated with these large refinancing requirements in the mid-term."

        "The Company has an arrangement with a finance company to provide floor plan financing for certain dealers. The Company receives payment from the finance company after shipment of product to the dealer. The Company participates in the cost of dealer financing up to certain limits and has agreed to repurchase products repossessed by the finance company but does not indemnify the finance company for any credit losses they incur. The amount financed by dealers which remained outstanding under this arrangement at December 31, 2023 and 2022 was approximately $158.0 million and $212.0 million, respectively.\n\n \n\nOn August 1, 2022, Power Home Solar, LLC d/b/a Pink Energy (PHS) filed a lawsuit in the Western District of Virginia against Generac Power Systems, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (Generac Power). The complaint alleges breaches of warranty, product liability, and other various causes of action against Generac Power relating to the sale and performance of certain clean energy equipment and seeks to recover damages, including consequential damages, that PHS allegedly incurred. The Company disputes the allegations in the complaint, including that PHS can seek consequential damages or amounts greater than the $25.0 million liability cap set forth in the agreement between the parties. Generac Power moved to dismiss the complaint and compel arbitration consistent with the parties’ agreement. PHS later filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition in the Western District of North Carolina that identified Generac Power as one of its outstanding creditors. The parties agreed to toll PHS’s deadline to respond to the motion to dismiss and all other pretrial deadlines to allow the bankruptcy trustee to evaluate the complaint. The Trustee has not yet taken further action in this lawsuit. Generac Power intends to vigorously defend against the claims in the complaint, in whichever forum they may proceed. \n\n \n\nOn October 28, 2022, Daniel Haak filed a putative consumer class action lawsuit against Generac Power in the Middle District of Florida. The complaint alleges breaches of warranty, tort-based, and unjust enrichment claims against Generac Power relating to the sale and performance of certain clean energy products, and seeks to recover damages, including consequential damages, that the plaintiff and putative class allegedly incurred. Additional putative class actions were filed by consumers raising similar claims and allegations in other district court cases. These putative class actions have been consolidated into a Multidistrict Litigation, In re: Generac Solar Power Systems Marketing, Sales Practices and Products Liability Litigation currently pending in the Eastern District of Wisconsin, Case No. 23-md-3078. Generac Power moved to dismiss claims in the consolidated master complaint, which is pending with the court. Generac Power and the Company intend to vigorously defend against the consolidated master complaint. \n\n \n\nOn December 1, 2022, Oakland County Voluntary Employees’ Beneficiary Association and Oakland County Employees’ Retirement System filed a putative securities class action lawsuit against the Company and certain of its officers in the Eastern District of Wisconsin. The court subsequently consolidated a later filed action and appointed a lead plaintiff. The lead plaintiff filed a consolidated complaint alleging violation of federal securities law related to disclosures of quality issues in Generac Power’s clean energy product, accounting for warranty reserves, reliance on channel partners, and demand for home standby generators (the “Oakland County Lawsuit”). The Company moved to dismiss the consolidated complaint on October 9, 2023. The Company disputes the allegations in the operative consolidated complaint and intends to vigorously defend against the claims in the consolidated class action. \n\n \n\nOn February 3, 2023, a purported Company shareholder filed a shareholder derivative action against certain of the Company’s officers and directors in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin. The complaint seeks unspecified damages on behalf of the Company and certain other relief, such as certain reforms to corporate governance practices. The complaint (in which the Company is named as a nominal defendant) generally alleges, among other things, breaches of fiduciary duties in connection with the oversight of the Company’s public statements and legal compliance, and that the Company was damaged as a result of the breaches of fiduciary duties, and the defendants were unjustly enriched. The complaint also alleges, among other things, violations of Sections 14(a), 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, abuse of control, gross mismanagement, and waste of corporate assets. The Company has received several additional derivative actions filed in both state and federal courts raising similar claims and allegations, including issues raised in the Oakland County Lawsuit. The Company disputes the allegations in the shareholder derivative actions and intends to vigorously defend against the claims in the complaints.\n\n \n\nOn October 28, 2022, Generac Power received a grand jury subpoena from the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Michigan, as a result of which the Company became aware of an enforcement investigation by the U.S. DOJ. The subpoena requests similar documents and information provided by the Company to the U.S. EPA and the CARB in response to civil document requests related to the Company’s compliance with emissions regulations for approximately 1.85 thousand portable generators produced by the Company in 2019 and 2020 and sold in 2020. The Company is cooperating with both the DOJ and the EPA and CARB inquiries. \n\n \n\nOn November 30, 2022, the CPSC notified the Company of its intention to recommend the imposition of a civil penalty for failing to timely submit a report to the CPSC in relation to certain portable generators that were subject to a voluntary recall previously announced on July 29, 2021. On May 3, 2023, the parties entered into a mutual settlement agreement. The agreement does not constitute an admission by Generac or a determination by the CPSC that Generac violated the CPSA. The terms of the settlement agreement require the Company to (i) abide by certain customary agency requirements regarding the ongoing commitment to the Company’s internal CPSA compliance practices and program, and (ii) pay a civil fine of $15.8 million. On July 21, 2023, Generac Power received a grand jury subpoena from the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Wisconsin, as a result of which the Company became aware of a continuing inquiry by the DOJ related to its statutory obligations under the CPSA in connection with this matter. Additionally, on October 23, 2023, the CPSC notified the Company that it is further investigating whether the Company complied with the reporting requirements to the CPSC in relation to certain portable generators that were subject to a voluntary recall previously announced on September 14, 2023. The Company is cooperating fully with both the CPSC and DOJ investigations and, at this time, is unable to predict the eventual scope, duration or final outcome of such investigations. \n\n \n\nIn 2019, EcoFactor, Inc. started a litigation campaign against smart thermostat manufacturers, including ecobee, Inc., which was acquired by the Company in 2021. EcoFactor accused ecobee of infringing its patents in three lawsuits filed in the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas and one lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware. On June 23, 2023, a jury issued a verdict in a consolidated action in the Western District of Texas (Case Nos. 21-cv-00428-ADA and 20-cv-00078-ADA) finding that ecobee infringed one of the two patents at issue and awarded a lump-sum payment of $5.4 million for past and future damages. On December 27, 2023, the parties reached a global settlement at an incremental cost of $4.6 million to resolve all remaining disputes between the parties, including the two remaining lawsuits.\n\n \n\nOn March 8, 2022, Ollnova Technologies Limited, a non-practicing entity, filed a patent infringement lawsuit against ecobee in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas (Case No. 22-cv-00072-JRG). Ollnova claimed that ecobee infringes on four of its patents. On October 5, 2023, a jury issued a verdict finding one of Ollnova’s patents invalid and that ecobee infringed at least one of the claims of the asserted patents and awarded a lump-sum payment of $11.5 million. ecobee intends to file motions for judgment as a matter of law and an appeal of any adverse judgment. \n\n \n\nOn June 9, 2023, Spartronics Vietnam, Inc., a contract manufacturer of Generac Power’s clean energy products, filed multiple lawsuits against Generac Power and sub-suppliers accusing Generac Power of fraud, breaching its supply agreement with Spartronics, tortiously interfering with Spartronics’ relationships with its sub-suppliers, and requesting a determination of rights under the parties’ agreements in state and federal court. Spartronics subsequently filed additional third-party complaints against Generac Power raising similar claims and allegations. Generac Power denies the allegations in the complaints, including that Generac Power is responsible for Spartronics purchasing practices, and moved for dismissal of the individual cases in favor of arbitration, and intends to pursue available claims in connection with the arbitration.\n\n \n\nOn November 21, 2023, Christopher Walling filed a putative securities class action lawsuit against the Company and certain of its officers in the Western District of Wisconsin and was later appointed lead plaintiff. The complaint asserts claims for alleged violation of federal securities law related to statements concerning the Company’s financial outlook and the impact of macroeconomic trends on the demand for its products. The plaintiff seeks to represent a class of individuals who purchased or otherwise acquired common stock between May 3, 2023 and August 3, 2023 and seeks unspecified compensatory damages and other relief on behalf of a purported class of purchasers of the Company’s stock (the “Walling Lawsuit”). The lead plaintiff has not yet filed an amended complaint or designated an operative complaint. The Company disputes the allegations in the initially-filed complaint and intends to defend itself vigorously in this action. \n\n \n\nOn February 14, 2024, a purported Company shareholder filed a derivative action against certain of the Company’s officers and directors in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin. The complaint (in which the Company is named as a nominal defendant) generally alleges, among other things, breaches of fiduciary duties in connection with the oversight of the Company’s public statements and legal compliance, including as to the claims raised in the Walling Lawsuit. The complaint seeks unspecified damages on behalf of the Company and certain other relief, including certain corporate governance reforms. The Company disputes the allegations in the shareholder derivative action and intends to vigorously defend against the claims in the complaint.\n\n \n\nIn the opinion of management, it is presently unlikely that any legal or regulatory proceedings pending against or involving the Company will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. However, in many of these matters, it is inherently difficult to determine whether a loss is probable or to estimate the size or range of the possible loss given the variety and potential outcomes of actual and potential claims, the uncertainty of future rulings, the behavior or incentives of adverse parties, and other factors outside the control of the Company. Accordingly, the Company’s loss reserves may change from time to time, and actual losses could exceed the amounts reserved by an amount that could be material to the Company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows in any particular reporting period."

This decline in the outstanding balance suggests several potential impacts on liquidity and working capital management:\n\n1. Improved Liquidity Position: A lower outstanding financing balance may indicate that dealers have either repaid more of their financing or that the Company has become more efficient with its receivables from its floor plan financing program. When dealers repay, the Company receives cash, effectively converting what was previously a receivable into available liquidity. This cash inflow can then be used for operations or other strategic needs.\n\n2. Reduced Credit Exposure: A lower financed balance also indicates that less capital is tied up in credit instruments. This reduction minimizes the risk of losses from potential dealer defaults and may lower the amount of capital reserved against potential credit losses, thereby strengthening the balance sheet.\n\n3. More Efficient Working Capital Management: The drop of around $54.0 million reflects a tighter control over the financing program. With fewer funds tied up in outstanding balances, the Company can potentially allocate more resources toward other working capital components, such as inventory management and payables. The faster turnover or conversion into cash can result in a healthier current asset base, contributing to better overall working capital management.\n\nWhile the available data does not provide a direct commentary on liquidity ratios or detailed cash conversion cycle metrics, it is reasonable to infer that the reduction in the floor plan financing balance has a positive influence by moving funds from a less liquid receivable (subject to credit risk and collection timing) to cash or cash equivalents. This change supports the Company’s broader liquidity profile and working capital efficiency."

        "As part of our market technology product offering, we enter into certain long-term contracts with customers to develop customized technology solutions, license the right to use software and provide support and other services to our customers which results in these contracts containing multiple performance obligations. We allocate the contract transaction price to each performance obligation using our best estimate of the standalone selling price of each distinct good or service in the contract. In instances where standalone selling price is not directly observable, such as when we do not sell the product or service separately, we determine the standalone selling price predominantly through an expected cost plus a margin approach.\nWe generally recognize revenue over time as our customers simultaneously receive and consume the benefits provided by our performance because our customer controls the asset for which we are creating, our performance does not create an asset with alternative use, and we have a right to payment for performance completed to date. For these services, we recognize revenue over time using costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion to measure progress toward satisfying our performance obligation. Incurred costs represent work performed, which corresponds with, and thereby depicts, the transfer of control to the customer.\nAccounting for our long-term contracts requires judgment relative to assessing risks and their impact on the estimate of revenues and costs. Our estimates are impacted by factors such as the potential for schedule and technical issues, productivity and the complexity of work performed. Revenue and cost estimates for our long-term contracts are reviewed and reassessed at least quarterly. When adjustments in estimated total contract costs are required, any changes in the estimated revenues from prior estimates are recognized in the current period for the effect of such change. If estimates of total costs to be incurred on a contract exceed estimates of total revenues, a provision for the entire estimated loss on the contract is recorded in the period in which the loss is determined.\nDue to the significance of judgment in the estimation process, as discussed above, changes in assumptions and estimates may adversely or positively affect financial performance in future periods.\nFor further discussion related to recognition of these revenues, see “Revenue From Contracts with Customers - Revenue Recognition - Market Technology,” of Note 2, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” to the consolidated financial statements."

        "Revenue is recognized when control of promised goods or services is transferred to the customer, in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services.\nWhen contracts with customers contain multiple performance obligations, the Company accounts for individual performance obligations separately if they are distinct. The transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation on a relative SSP basis. The Company determines the SSP by using the price charged for a deliverable when sold separately or uses management’s best estimate of SSP for goods or services not sold separately using estimation techniques that maximize observable data points, including: internal factors relevant to its pricing practices such as costs and margin objectives; standalone sales prices of similar products; pricing policies; percentage of the fee charged for a primary product or service relative to a related product or service; and geography.\nSales, usage-based, value added and other taxes are excluded from revenues.\nMA Revenue\nIn the MA segment, products and services offered by the Company include hosted research and data subscriptions, installed and hosted software subscriptions, perpetual installed software licenses and related maintenance, or PCS, and professional services. Subscription and PCS contracts are generally invoiced in advance of the contractual coverage period, which is principally one year, but can range from 3-5 years. Professional services are invoiced as those services are provided. Payment terms and conditions vary by contract type, but primarily include a requirement of payment within 30 to 60 days.\nRevenue from research, data and other hosted subscriptions is recognized ratably over the related subscription period as MA's performance obligation to provide access to these products is progressively fulfilled over the stated term of the contract. A large portion of these services are invoiced in the months of November, December and January.\nRevenue from the sale of a software license, when considered distinct from the related software implementation services, is generally recognized at the time the product master or first copy is delivered or transferred to the customer. PCS is generally recognized ratably over the contractual period commencing when the software license is fully delivered. Revenue from installed software subscriptions, which includes PCS, is bifurcated into a software license performance obligation and a PCS performance obligation, which follow the patterns of recognition described above, except for those installed subscriptions where the software license and PCS performance obligations were determined to be incapable of being distinct from each other in accordance with ASC 606-10-25-19 and ASC 606-10-25-20. In such instances, revenue is recognized over time.\nFor implementation services and other service projects for which fees are fixed, the Company determined progress towards completion is most accurately measured on a percentage-of-completion basis (input method) as this approach utilizes the most directly observable data points and is therefore used to recognize the related revenue. For implementation services where price varies based on time expended, a time-based measure of progress towards completion of the performance obligation is utilized.\nRevenue from professional services rendered is generally recognized over time as the services are performed.\nProducts and services offered within the MA segment are sold either stand-alone or together in various combinations. In instances where an arrangement contains multiple performance obligations, the Company accounts for the individual performance obligations separately if they are considered distinct. Revenue is generally allocated to all performance obligations based upon the relative SSP at contract inception. For certain performance obligations, judgment is required to determine the SSP. Revenue is recognized for each performance obligation based upon the conditions for revenue recognition noted above.\nIn the MA segment, customers usually pay a fixed fee for the products and services based on signed contracts. However, accounting for variable consideration is applied mainly for: i) estimates for cancellation rights and price concessions and ii) T&M based services.\nThe Company estimates the variable consideration associated with cancellation rights and price concessions based on the expected amount to be provided to customers and reduces the amount of revenue to be recognized.\nMIS Revenue\nIn the MIS segment, revenue arrangements with multiple elements are generally comprised of two distinct performance obligations, a rating and the related monitoring service. Revenue attributed to ratings of issued securities is generally recognized when the rating is delivered to the issuer. Revenue attributed to monitoring of issuers or issued securities is recognized ratably over the period in which the monitoring is performed, generally one year. In the case of certain structured finance products, primarily CMBS, issuers can elect to pay all of the annual monitoring fees upfront. These fees are deferred and recognized over the future monitoring periods based on the expected lives of the rated securities.\nMIS arrangements generally have standard contractual terms for which the stated payments are due at conclusion of the ratings process for ratings and either upfront or in arrears for monitoring services; and are signed by customers either on a per issue basis or at the beginning of the relationship with the customer. In situations when customer fees for an arrangement may be variable, the Company estimates the variable consideration at inception using the expected value method based on analysis of similar contracts in the same line of business, which is constrained based on the Company’s assessment of the realization of the adjustment amount.\nThe Company allocates the transaction price within arrangements that include multiple performance obligations based upon the relative SSP of each service. The SSP for both rating and monitoring services is generally based upon observable selling prices where the rating or monitoring service is sold separately to similar customers.\nCosts to Obtain or Fulfill a Contract with a Customer:\nCosts to obtain a contract with a customer\nCosts incurred to obtain customer contracts, such as sales commissions, are deferred and recorded within other current assets and other assets when such costs are determined to be incremental to obtaining a contract, would not have been incurred otherwise and the Company expects to recover those costs. These costs are amortized to expense on a systematic basis consistent with the transfer of the products or services to the customer. Depending on the line of business to which the contract relates, this may be based upon the average economic life of the products sold or average period for which services are provided, inclusive of anticipated contract renewals. Determining the estimated economic life of the products sold requires judgment with respect to anticipated future technological changes. Costs to obtain customer contracts are only incurred in the MA segment.\nCost to fulfill a contract with a customer\nCosts incurred to fulfill customer contracts, are deferred and recorded within other current assets and other assets when such costs relate directly to a contract, generate or enhance resources of the Company that will be used in satisfying performance obligations in the future and the Company expects to recover those costs.\nThe Company capitalizes royalty costs within the MA segment related to third-party information data providers associated with hosted company information and business intelligence products. These costs are amortized to expense consistent with the recognition pattern of the related revenue over time.\nIn addition, the Company capitalizes work-in-process costs for in-progress MIS ratings, which is recognized consistent with the rendering of the related services to the customers, as ratings are issued."

First, if the deliverable is sold separately, the SSP is derived from the price charged for that deliverable on a stand‐alone basis. When such a direct selling price is unavailable, Moody’s uses management’s best estimate of the SSP. In making this estimate, the Company employs estimation techniques that are designed to maximize the use of observable data points while taking into account several internal factors. These factors include: \n• The internal pricing practices, which consist of the costs incurred to provide the product or service and the margin objectives that Moody’s aims to achieve.\n• The standalone sales prices of similar products or services offered in the market.\n• The company’s pricing policies and its approach to allocating fees across primary and related products or services (e.g., the percentage of the fee charged for a primary product relative to a related product).\n• Geographic considerations that may impact pricing based on regional market conditions.\n\nChanges in these estimates can have a material impact on overall revenue allocation. Since the transaction price is allocated to individual performance obligations based on their relative SSP, any adjustment—whether from revised internal cost estimates, shifts in margin objectives, changes in market pricing data, or updated pricing policies—could lead to a reallocation of the revenue among the performance obligations. This might affect the timing and pattern of revenue recognition as the Company’s obligations are fulfilled, potentially influencing reported financial performance and comparability over time."

        "FCX recognizes revenue for its products upon transfer of control in an amount that reflects the consideration it expects to receive in exchange for those products. Transfer of control is in accordance with the terms of customer contracts, which is generally upon shipment or delivery of the product. While payment terms vary by contract, terms generally include payment to be made within 30 days, but not longer than 60 days. Certain of FCX’s concentrate and cathode sales contracts also provide for provisional pricing, which is accounted for as an embedded derivative (refer to Note 14 for further discussion). For provisionally priced sales, 90% to 100% of the provisional invoice amount is collected upon shipment or within 20 days, and final balances are settled in a contractually specified future month (generally one to four months from the shipment date) based on quoted monthly average copper settlement prices on the London Metal Exchange (LME) or the Commodity Exchange Inc. (COMEX), and quoted monthly average London Bullion Market Association (London) PM gold prices.\n\nFCX’s product revenues are also recorded net of treatment charges, royalties and export duties. Moreover, because a portion of the metals contained in copper concentrate is unrecoverable as a result of the smelting process, FCX’s revenues from concentrate sales are also recorded net of allowances based on the quantity and value of these unrecoverable metals. These allowances are a negotiated term of FCX’s contracts and vary by customer. Treatment and refining charges represent payments or price adjustments to smelters and refiners that are generally fixed. Refer to Note 16 for a summary of revenue by product type.\n\nGold sales are priced according to individual contract terms, generally the average London PM gold price for a specified month near the month of shipment.\n\nThe majority of FCX’s molybdenum sales are priced based on the Platts Metals Daily Molybdenum Dealer Oxide weekly average price, plus conversion premiums for products that undergo additional processing, such as ferromolybdenum and molybdenum chemical products, for the month prior to the month of shipment."

      "ground_truth": "The provided data allows us to assess the potential risks and benefits associated with the different pricing mechanisms employed for copper, gold, and molybdenum sales. Key points include:\n\n1. Risks:\n   • Copper: The use of provisional pricing and embedded derivatives in certain copper concentrate and cathode sales introduces pricing volatility risk. Since only 90% to 100% of the provisional invoice amount is collected upfront and the final balance is determined based on future market prices (LME or COMEX), the company is exposed to market price fluctuations. This can lead to revenue variability, mismatches between booked revenue and eventual realization, and potential liquidity challenges if there are delays or disputes in price settlement.\n   • Molybdenum: Pricing based on the Platts Metals Daily Molybdenum Dealer Oxide weekly average (plus conversion premiums) exposes the company to risks related to weekly market fluctuations. Any significant variance in market conditions or conversion premium pressures could impact profitability for these sales.\n   • Complexity and Accounting Risk: The embedded derivative treatment for provisionally priced contracts adds complexity to revenue recognition, which can lead to potential accounting and valuation challenges. Inaccurate projections or misestimation in these embedded elements may affect investor confidence and overall valuation.\n\n2. Benefits:\n   • Diversification of Revenue Streams: By pricing gold strictly based on the average London PM gold price and copper using both upfront recognition and later adjustments, the company diversifies its revenue recognition models. This diversification can help stabilize overall revenue since gold, typically seen as a safe haven, may provide a stabilizing effect when copper or molybdenum markets are volatile.\n   • Market Alignment: Aligning pricing with established market benchmarks (LME/COMEX for copper, London PM for gold, and Platts for molybdenum) ensures that the company’s revenues are responsive to market conditions. This can be beneficial in periods of rising commodity prices, potentially leading to enhanced margins and supporting future growth.\n   • Competitive Positioning: The different contractual terms may allow Freeport-McMoRan to negotiate favorable terms with customers and adapt to market conditions. For instance, provisional pricing can allow the company to capture a higher price if market conditions are favorable at the time of final settlement.\n\nOverall, while the complex pricing mechanisms inherent in copper and molybdenum sales introduce risks such as revenue volatility, liquidity concerns, and accounting complexities, they also offer benefits by aligning revenue more closely with market conditions and diversifying revenue sources. These factors can ultimately influence the company’s future growth prospects and overall valuation by balancing the risk of short-term variability with the potential to capture value from favorable market movements. Investors should consider these nuances when evaluating the sustainability of revenue streams and growth potential."

      "ground_truth": "The provided information allows us to infer that planned price increases and investments in value‐added capabilities are key elements of PTC Inc.'s capital allocation strategy. By increasing prices, the company not only aims to boost short-term revenue growth but also to enhance its Annual Run Rate (ARR) and overall cash flow. This, in turn, supports reinvestments in enabling technologies such as SaaS platforms, AI software, IoT, and augmented reality—all of which contribute to making its principal products and services (like PLM, ALM, SLM, and CAD) more robust and competitive.\n\nHere’s how these strategies support the capital structure and potential implications:\n\n1. Capital Allocation Strategy Support:\n   • Price Increases: By raising prices, especially in an environment where digital transformation and value-added capabilities are in demand, PTC Inc. can generate higher margins and improve cash flow. This enhanced cash flow enables the company to reinvest in its technology infrastructure and strategic initiatives, supporting growth among existing clients and attracting new ones.\n   • Investments in Value-Added Capabilities: Allocating capital towards enhancing its product suite (e.g., integrating SaaS, AR, AI, and IoT) reinforces its market positioning, accelerates customer adoption, and extends product lifecycles. These investments likely generate economies of scale and build a competitive moat over time.\n\n2. Implications for Valuation and Future Earnings Growth:\n   • Valuation Metrics: Higher ARR and improved cash flow resulting from a combined pricing strategy and high-value technology investments can lead investors to assign a premium to the company's future earnings potential. This improved outlook typically results in an upward re-rating in valuation multiples, as earnings stability and growth prospects become more attractive.\n   • Future Earnings Growth: Enhanced product capabilities and service offerings not only justify price increases but also can drive higher recurring revenues (especially in a SaaS model), leading to sustainable margin improvements, stronger recurring revenue streams, and better organic growth rates. This may eventually accelerate EPS (earnings per share) growth, contributing positively to long-term shareholder value.\n\nOverall, by aligning price increases with technology investments, PTC Inc. is positioning itself to fortify both its competitive advantage and its financial strength. The strategy should translate into higher future earnings growth and an improved overall valuation profile by leveraging enhanced cash flow and a robust ARR as key drivers of financial performance."

        "Competition in the biopharmaceutical industry and the markets in which we operate is intense. There are many companies, including biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, engaged in developing products for the indications our approved products are approved to treat and the therapeutic areas we are targeting with our research and development activities. Some of our competitors may have substantially greater financial, marketing, research and development and other resources than we do.\nWe believe that competition and leadership in the industry is based on scientific, managerial and technological excellence and innovation as well as establishing patent and other proprietary positions through research and development. The achievement of a leadership position also depends largely upon our ability to maximize the approval, acceptance and use of our product candidates and the availability of adequate financial resources to fund facilities, equipment, personnel, clinical testing, manufacturing and marketing. Another key aspect of remaining competitive in the industry is recruiting and retaining leading scientists and technicians to conduct our research activities and advance our development programs, including with the regulatory and commercial expertise to effectively advance and market our products.\nCompetition among products approved for sale may be based, among other things, on patent position, product efficacy, safety, patient convenience, delivery devices, reliability, availability, reimbursement and price. In addition, early entry of a new pharmaceutical product into the market may have important advantages in gaining product acceptance and market share. Accordingly, the relative speed with which we can develop products, complete the testing and approval process and supply commercial quantities of products will have a significant impact on our competitive position.\nThe introduction of new products or technologies, including the development of new processes or technologies by competitors or new information about existing products or technologies, results in increased competition for our marketed products and pricing pressure on our marketed products. The development of new or improved treatment options or standards of care or cures for the diseases our products treat reduces and could eliminate the use of our products or may limit the utility and application of ongoing clinical trials for our product candidates.\nIn addition, the commercialization of certain of our own approved products, products of our collaborators and pipeline product candidates may negatively impact future sales of our existing products.\nWe believe our long-term competitive position depends upon our success in discovering and developing innovative, cost-effective products that serve unmet medical needs, along with our ability to manufacture products efficiently and to launch and market them effectively in a highly competitive environment.\nAdditional information about the competition that our marketed products face is set forth below and in Item 1A. Risk Factors included in this report.\nNEUROLOGY\nMULTIPLE SCLEROSIS\nOur MS products and revenue streams continue to face increasing competition in many markets from the introduction of generic versions, prodrugs and biosimilars of existing products and products approved under abbreviated regulatory pathways. Such products are likely to be sold at substantially lower prices than branded products. Accordingly, the introduction of such products as well as other lower-priced competing products may significantly reduce both the price that we are able to charge for our products and the volume of products we sell, which will negatively impact our revenue. In some jurisdictions a decrease in reimbursed price is mandated by law. In addition, in some markets, when a generic or biosimilar version of one of our products is commercialized, it may be automatically substituted for our product and significantly reduce our revenue in a short period of time.\nCompetition in the MS market is intense. Along with us, a number of companies are working to develop additional treatments for MS that may in the future compete with our MS products. One such product that was approved in the U.S. in 2017 and in the E.U. in 2018 is OCREVUS, a treatment for RMS and PPMS that was developed by Genentech. While we have a financial interest in OCREVUS, future sales of our MS products may be adversely affected if OCREVUS continues to gain market share, or if other MS products that we or our competitors are developing are commercialized.TECFIDERA, AVONEX, PLEGRIDY, TYSABRI and VUMERITY each compete with one or more of the following branded products as well as generic and biosimilar versions of some of these products:\nCompeting Product\t\tCompetitor\nAUBAGIO (teriflunomide)\t\tSanofi Genzyme\nBAFIERTAM (monomethyl fumarate)\t\tBanner Life Sciences\nBETASERON/BETAFERON (interferon-beta-1b)\t\tBayer Group\nBRIUMVI (ublituximab-xiiy)\t\tTG Therapeutics, Inc.\nCOPAXONE (glatiramer acetate)\t\tTeva Pharmaceuticals Industries Ltd.\nEXTAVIA (interferon-beta-1b)\t\tNovartis AG\nGILENYA (fingolimod)\t\tNovartis AG\nGLATOPA (glatiramer acetate)\t\tSandoz, a division of Novartis AG\nKESIMPTA (ofatumumab)\t\tNovartis AG\nLEMTRADA (alemtuzumab)\t\tSanofi Genzyme\nMAVENCLAD (cladribine)\t\tEMD Serono\nMAYZENT (siponimod)\t\tNovartis AG\nOCREVUS (ocrelizumab)\t\tGenentech\nPONVORY (ponesimod)\t\tJanssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson\nREBIF (interferon-beta-1)\t\tEMD Serono\nTYRUKO (natalizumab-sztn)\t\tSandoz, a division of Novartis AG\nZEPOSIA (ozanimod)\t\tBristol Myers Squibb Company\n \nMultiple TECFIDERA generic entrants are now in North America, Brazil and certain E.U. countries and have deeply discounted prices compared to TECFIDERA.\nFollowing a favorable March 2023 decision of the CJEU affirming TECFIDERA's right to regulatory data and marketing protection and the EC determination in May 2023 that TECFIDERA is entitled to an additional year of market protection for its pediatric indication, we believe that TECFIDERA is entitled to regulatory marketing protection in the E.U. until at least February 2, 2025, and are seeking to enforce this protection. In December 2023, the EC revoked all centralized marketing authorizations for generic versions of TECFIDERA. As of December 31, 2023, some of the TECFIDERA generics have not yet fully exited some E.U. markets and we expect removal of all generics from the market will take additional time. We are closely monitoring this situation and working to enforce our legal right to market protection. In addition, we will continue to enforce our EP 2 653 873 patent related to TECFIDERA, which expires in 2028.\nThe generic competition for TECFIDERA has significantly reduced our TECFIDERA revenue and we expect that TECFIDERA revenue will continue to decline in the future.\nWe are also aware of a biosimilar entrant of TYSABRI that was approved in the U.S. in August 2023 and the E.U. in September 2023. We believe that future sales of TYSABRI may be adversely affected by the entrance of this biosimilar.\nFor additional information on the U.S. patent litigation related to a TYSABRI biosimilar, please read Note 21, Litigation, to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.\nALZHEIMER'S DISEASE\nThe market for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease is undeveloped and could be subject to rapid change in the future. Most current treatments are symptomatic or intended to improve quality of life. Along with us, several companies are working to develop additional treatments. Most recently, we codeveloped LEQEMBI, a treatment to address a defining pathology of Alzheimer's disease and we and our collaborator Eisai are in the process of launching this product. We are aware of other products now in development that, if approved, may also compete with LEQEMBI.RARE DISEASE\nSPINAL MUSCULAR ATROPHY\nWe face competition from a gene therapy product ZOLGENSMA (onasemnogene abeparvovec-xioi) and an oral product EVRYSDI (risdiplam). We expect that we will experience competition from both products in additional jurisdictions in the future, which may adversely affect our sales of SPINRAZA.\nAdditionally, we are aware of other products now in development that, if launched, may also compete with SPINRAZA. Future sales of SPINRAZA may be adversely affected by the commercialization of competing products.\nFRIEDREICH'S ATAXIA\nSKYCLARYS is the first treatment on the market for this indication and could face future competition from pipeline programs under development.\nBIOSIMILARS\nBENEPALI, IMRALDI and FLIXABI, the three biosimilar products we currently commercialize in certain countries in Europe pursuant to an agreement with Samsung Bioepis, compete with their reference products, ENBREL, HUMIRA and REMICADE, respectively, as well as other biosimilars of those reference products.\nBYOOVIZ, a biosimilar product we currently commercialize in the U.S. and certain international markets pursuant to an agreement with Samsung Bioepis, competes with its reference product LUCENTIS, as well as other biosimilars of this reference product.\nGENENTECH RELATIONSHIPS IN OTHER INDICATIONS\nRITUXAN, RITUXAN HYCELA, GAZYVA and LUNSUMIO in Oncology\nRITUXAN, RITUXAN HYCELA, GAZYVA and LUNSUMIO compete with a number of therapies in the oncology market, including TREANDA (bendamustine HCL), ARZERRA (ofatumumab), IMBRUVICA (ibrutinib) and ZYDELIG (idelalisib) and other new innovative oncological therapies.\nBiosimilar products referencing RITUXAN have launched in the U.S and are being offered at lower prices. This competition has had a significant adverse impact on the pre-tax profits of our collaboration arrangements with Genentech, as the sales of RITUXAN have decreased substantially compared to prior periods. We expect that biosimilar competition will continue to increase as these products capture additional market share and that this will have a significant adverse impact on our co-promotion profits in the U.S. in future years.\nRITUXAN in Rheumatoid Arthritis\nRITUXAN competes with several different types of therapies in the rheumatoid arthritis market, including, among others, traditional disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs such as steroids, methotrexate and cyclosporine, TNF inhibitors, ORENCIA (abatacept), ACTEMRA (tocilizumab) and XELJANZ (tofacitinib) and biosimilar versions of RITUXAN.\nWe are also aware of other products, including biosimilars, in development that, if approved, may compete with RITUXAN in the rheumatoid arthritis market.",
        "SALES FORCE AND MARKETING\nWe promote our marketed products worldwide, including in the U.S., Europe and Japan, primarily through our own sales forces and marketing groups. In some countries, particularly in areas where we continue to expand into new geographic areas, we partner with third parties.\nRITUXAN, RITUXAN HYCELA, GAZYVA, OCREVUS and LUNSUMIO are marketed by the Roche Group and its sublicensees.\nWe commercialize BENEPALI, IMRALDI and FLIXABI pursuant to our agreement with Samsung Bioepis in certain countries in Europe, as well as BYOOVIZ in the U.S. and certain international markets.\nWe focus our sales and marketing efforts on physicians in private practice or at major medical centers. We use customary industry practices to market our products and to educate physicians. This includes our sales representatives calling on individual health care providers (in-person and virtually), advertisements, professional symposia, direct mail, digital marketing, point of care marketing, public relations and other methods. We focus on health care provider sales and marketing efforts on specialty providers in both private practice and at major medical centers.\nDISTRIBUTION ARRANGEMENTS\nWe distribute our products in the U.S. principally through wholesale and specialty distributors of pharmaceutical products and specialty pharmacies, mail order specialty distributors or shipping service providers. In other countries, the distribution of our products varies from country to country, including through wholesale distributors of pharmaceutical products and third-party distribution partners who are responsible for most marketing and distribution activities.\nRITUXAN, RITUXAN HYCELA, GAZYVA, OCREVUS and LUNSUMIO are distributed by the Roche Group and its sublicensees.\nWe distribute BENEPALI, IMRALDI and FLIXABI in certain countries in Europe and have an option to acquire exclusive rights to distribute these products in China, as well as BYOOVIZ in the U.S. and certain international markets.\nOur product sales to two wholesale distributors each accounted for more than 10.0% of our total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, and on a combined basis, accounted for approximately 36.9%, 37.9% and 38.9%, respectively, of our gross product revenue.

      "ground_truth": "The provided information indicates that while Biogen has taken steps to enforce its patent rights and secure additional regulatory protection for products such as TECFIDERA, these measures have had mixed effects. Specifically, the data shows that following favorable regulatory decisions – such as the CJEU ruling in March 2023 and the EC determination in May 2023 – Biogen successfully extended TECFIDERA’s market protection in Europe until at least February 2025 and even secured the revocation of centralized marketing authorizations for generics in December 2023. However, despite these enforcement actions, generic competition, particularly in the TECFIDERA market, has had a significant negative impact on the product’s revenue. The narrative explicitly states that the entrance of generics has “significantly reduced our TECFIDERA revenue” and that further declines in revenue are expected as generics continue to capture market share. In summary, although enforcement of patent protection and regulatory strategies have delayed the market entry of generics to some extent, they have not fully countered the revenue erosion and market share loss caused by increasing generic competition."

      "question": "Risks related to external financing, alongside growth potential and competitive positioning, must be assessed for Hasbro (HAS).",
      "reference": [
        "The Company has historically generated a significant amount of cash from operations. In 2023, the Company primarily funded its operations and liquidity needs through cash on hand and from cash flows from operations, commercial paper, and when needed, used borrowings under its available lines of credit. In addition, the Company’s Entertainment operating segment used production financing to fund certain of its television and film productions which are typically arranged on an individual production basis by using either the Company's senior revolving film and television production credit facility or through special purpose production subsidiaries. The senior revolving credit facility dedicated to production financing and individual production loans were assumed by Lionsgate effective upon the closing of the sale of eOne Film and TV in the fourth quarter of 2023. For more information on the Company's production financing facilities, see notes 3, 9 and 11 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements, of this Form 10-K.\nDuring 2024, the Company expects to continue to fund its working capital needs primarily through available cash, cash flows from operations and, if needed, by issuing commercial paper or borrowing under its revolving credit agreement. The Company believes that the funds available to it, including cash expected to be generated from operations, funds available through its commercial paper program or its available lines of credit, are adequate to meet its working capital needs for 2024, including the repayment of the current portion of long-term debt of $500.0 million, as shown on the Consolidated Balance Sheets which represents the Company's 3% fixed-rate notes due in November 2024. The Company may also issue debt or equity securities from time to time, to provide additional sources of liquidity when pursuing opportunities to enhance our long-term competitive position, while maintaining a strong balance sheet. However, unexpected events or circumstances such as material operating losses or increased capital or other expenditures, or the inability to otherwise access the commercial paper market, may reduce or eliminate the availability of external financial resources. In addition, significant disruptions to credit markets may also reduce or eliminate the availability of external financial resources. Although the Company believes the risk of nonperformance by the counterparties to its financial facilities is not significant, in times of severe economic downturn in the credit markets, it is possible that one or more sources of external financing may be unable or unwilling to provide funding to the Company.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company’s cash and cash equivalents totaled $545.4 million. Prior to 2017, deferred income taxes had not been provided on the majority of undistributed earnings of international subsidiaries as such earnings were indefinitely reinvested by the Company. Accordingly, such international cash balances were not available to fund cash requirements in the United States unless the Company was to change its reinvestment policy. The Company has maintained sufficient sources of cash in the United States to fund cash requirements without the need to repatriate any funds. The Tax Act provided significant changes to the U.S. tax system including the elimination of the ability to defer U.S. income tax on unrepatriated earnings by imposing a one-time mandatory deemed repatriation tax on undistributed foreign earnings. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had a total liability of $103.3 million related to this tax, $45.9 million is reflected in current liabilities and represents the Company's 2024 payment while the remaining long-term payable related to the Tax Act of $57.4 million, which represents the Company's final interest free installment due in 2025, is presented within Other liabilities, non-current on the Consolidated Balance Sheets included in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements, of this Form 10-K. As a result of the Tax Act and associated repatriation tax payments, earnings in foreign jurisdictions are made available with greater investment flexibility. The majority of the Company’s cash and cash equivalents held outside of the United States as of December 31, 2023 are denominated in the U.S. dollar.",
        "The table below outlines key financial information pertaining to our Consolidated Balance Sheets including the year-over-year changes, expressed in millions of dollars.\n2023\t\t%\t\t2022\t\t%\t\t2021\nCash and cash equivalents, net of short-term borrowings (including restricted cash of $0.6, $14.5 and $35.8)\n$\t545.4 \t\t\t6 \t%\t\t$\t513.1 \t\t\t-50 \t%\t\t$\t1,019.2 \t\nAccounts receivable, net\t1,029.3 \t\t\t-9 \t%\t\t1,132.4 \t\t\t-25 \t%\t\t1,500.4 \t\nInventories\t332.0 \t\t\t-51 \t%\t\t676.8 \t\t\t23 \t%\t\t552.1 \t\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets\t416.9 \t\t\t-38 \t%\t\t676.8 \t\t\t3 \t%\t\t656.4 \t\nOther assets\t862.0 \t\t\t-46 \t%\t\t1,589.3 \t\t\t23 \t%\t\t1,297.0 \t\nAccounts payable and accrued liabilities\t1,556.4 \t\t\t-20 \t%\t\t1,934.1 \t\t\t-14 \t%\t\t2,255.0 \t\nOther liabilities\t431.7 \t\t\t-19 \t%\t\t533.1 \t\t\t-21 \t%\t\t670.7 \t\n \nAccounts receivable, net decreased 9% in 2023 compared to 2022. The decrease in accounts receivable reflects the removal of receivable balances included as part of the sale of the eOne Film and TV business during the fourth quarter of 2023, combined with lower revenues during 2023 compared to 2022. Days sales outstanding increased from 61 days at December 25, 2022 to 73 days at December 31, 2023, reflecting lower revenues and mix of sales during 2023. Accounts receivable, net decreased 25% in 2022 compared to 2021. The decrease in accounts receivable during 2022 was driven by lower sales and improved collections across the majority of the Company's markets during 2022. Days sales outstanding decreased from 68 days at December 26, 2021 to 61 days at December 25, 2022, primarily due to the improved collections described above.\nInventories decreased 51% in 2023 compared to 2022, reflecting enterprise-wide efforts to reduce retail inventory levels while improving the quality of inventory on hand. Inventory management efforts included inventory scrap and obsolescence write-downs for excess or obsolete inventory, most notably in the U.S. and Europe and within the Consumer Products and Wizards of the Coast tabletop gaming businesses, in addition to increases to inventory obsolescence reserves, as the Company looks toward 2024. Inventories increased 23% in 2022 compared to 2021, primarily reflecting accelerated inventory purchases attributable to the Company's Consumer Products and Wizards of the Coast businesses, to mitigate the impact of certain global supply chain challenges. However, as global supply chain constraints began to subside in 2022, the Company experienced lower than anticipated Consumer Products sales, resulting in higher inventory levels.\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets decreased 38% in 2023 compared to 2022, driven primarily by lower accrued income balances and lower accrued tax credits for film and television production costs attributable to the eOne Film and TV business, sold during the fourth quarter of 2023. These decreases were partially offset by higher accrued royalty and licensing balances and higher prepaid income tax balances reflecting the reclassification of the Company's 2023 transition tax liability installment payment due in April 2024, which is increasing to $45.9 million, from $34.4 million paid in 2023. In 2022, prepaid expenses and other current assets increased 3% driven by higher accrued royalty and licensing balances, primarily attributable to the Company's Entertainment business as well as the reclassification of certain accrued income balances from long-term to current. These increases were partially offset by lower prepaid royalty balances in relation to the Company’s MARVEL, POWER RANGERS and DISNEY PRINCESS royalty agreements, the disposal of certain Entertainment assets in relation to the exit of certain non-core businesses within the Entertainment segment and from lower prepaid income tax balances during 2022.\nOther assets decreased 46% in 2023 compared to 2022. The decrease primarily reflects the removal of long-term asset balances as a result of the sale of the eOne Film and TV business including balances for investments in film and television productions, non-current receivables and acquired intangible assets. Lower acquired intangible asset balances also reflects impairment write-downs of the definite-lived intangible eOne Trademark and the definite-lived PJ MASKS intangible asset. In addition, lower balances for the Company's investment in Discovery Family Channel, due to distributions received, contributed to the decrease in other assets during 2023. These decreases were partially offset by higher deferred tax balances as a result of a certain tax basis increase. Other assets increased 23% in 2022 compared to 2021. The increase was primarily driven by higher deferred tax balances, higher investments in film and television productions and higher non-current receivable balances within the Entertainment segment. These increases were partially offset by a lower balance for the Company's investment in Discovery Family Channel, due to distributions received during 2022.\nAccounts payable and accrued liabilities decreased 20% in 2023 compared to 2022. The decrease was driven by lower accounts payable and accrued liability balances attributable to the eOne Film and TV business sold during the fourth quarter of 2023, including accrued participations, accrued expenses in relation to investments in film and\ntelevision content and productions, and certain accounts payable balances that were included with the sale. In addition, the decrease to Accounts payable and accrued liabilities was driven by lower accounts payable balances associated with the Company's global cost savings initiatives and the timing of payments. These decreases were partially offset by higher accrued royalty balances associated with the Company's digital gaming business, higher accrued income tax balances and higher incentive bonus accrual balances. Accounts payable and accrued liabilities decreased 14% in 2022 compared to 2021. The drivers of the decrease include lower accounts payable balances associated with the Company's global cost savings initiatives and the timing of payments in 2022, lower incentive bonus accruals, lower accrued royalty balances as a result of partner brand product sales declines, lower accrued freight balances due to improving supply chain conditions within certain markets, as well as the disposal of certain Entertainment liabilities in relation to the exit of non-core businesses within the Entertainment segment. These decreases were partially offset by higher severance accrual balances related to certain cost savings initiatives mentioned above.\nOther liabilities decreased 19% in 2023 compared to 2022 reflecting lower lease liability balances and lower long-term deferred income tax balances associated with the eOne Film and TV business sold during the fourth quarter of 2023. In addition, the decrease in Other liabilities was driven by a lower transition tax liability balance reflecting the reclassification of the 2023 installment payment due April 2024, and lower long-term deferred tax balances reflecting the amortization of deferred tax liabilities attributable to legacy Hasbro businesses. These decreases were partially offset by a higher long-term lease liability balance attributable to a lease entered during the first nine months of 2023 in support of the Wizards of the Coast and Digital Gaming segment. Other liabilities decreased 21% in 2022 compared to 2021. The decrease was driven by a lower transition tax liability balance reflecting the reclassification of the 2022 installment payment due April 2023, lower long-term lease liability balances, lower deferred tax balances reflecting the amortization of certain deferred tax liabilities and the impact of foreign exchange revaluation, primarily related to the British Pound. These decreases were partially offset by an increase to the liability for uncertain tax positions, primarily related to the capitalization of research and experimentation expenditures."

      "ground_truth": "The provided data clearly outlines several potential risks that could impede Hasbro’s ability to secure external financing. Key risks include:\n\n1. Disruptions in Credit Markets: The company’s financing strategy relies partly on commercial paper and borrowings under revolving credit facilities. In times of credit market disruption, these sources may become either unavailable or more expensive, leading to higher financing costs or a shortfall in working capital. This risk is particularly significant during severe economic downturns where lenders might restrict or stop funding entirely.\n\n2. Unexpected Operating Losses and Increased Capital Expenditures: If Hasbro experiences material operating losses or incurs higher than anticipated capital expenditures, its cash flows from operations could be adversely affected. Reduced operational cash flow would increase the company’s reliance on external financing. If operating performance deteriorates, it could lead to a negative feedback loop where reduced funding means less ability to invest in growth or manage operational risks.\n\nImpact on Future Growth and Competitive Positioning:\n\n• Reduced Liquidity and Flexibility: If access to external financing is constrained, Hasbro might have to scale back on investments in new projects, marketing, or other strategic opportunities essential for long-term growth.\n\n• Weakened Competitive Positioning: Inability to secure funding might force the company to forego strategic expenditures that enhance its market position, such as product innovation or expansion into new markets. This could allow competitors to capture market share, adversely impacting Hasbro’s competitive edge over time.\n\n• Elevated Financing Costs: A constrained credit environment could increase borrowing costs. This would not only reduce immediate liquidity but also adversely affect the company’s return on investment in growth initiatives, potentially putting Hasbro at a strategic disadvantage compared to competitors with more secure or lower-cost financing options.\n\nOverall, while Hasbro currently maintains adequate liquidity through various sources (including cash on hand and operational cash flows), any significant disruption in these areas or an unexpected downturn in operational performance could hinder its ability to fund growth, thereby impacting its long-term competitive positioning."

        "Premiums are recognized as revenues over the period of the contract in proportion to the amount of insurance protection provided, which is generally pro rata over the policy period. Unearned premium reserves represent the unexpired portion of policy premiums. Accrued retrospective premiums are included in premium balances receivable. Premium balances receivable are reported net of an allowance for expected credit losses. The allowance is based upon the Company’s ongoing review of amounts outstanding, historical loss data, including delinquencies and write-offs, current and forecasted economic conditions and other relevant factors. Credit risk is partially mitigated by the Company’s ability to cancel the policy if the policyholder does not pay the premium.\nCeded premiums are charged to income over the applicable term of the various reinsurance contracts with third party reinsurers. Prepaid reinsurance premiums represent the unexpired portion of premiums ceded to reinsurers and are reported as ceded unearned premiums, an asset on the consolidated balance sheet.\nFee Income\nFee income includes revenues from risk and claims management services provided to the Company’s insureds and third-party non-insureds, as well as policy issuance and claims management services to workers’ compensation residual market pools. Fee income is earned over the policy period for the services provided to the Company’s insureds, and either over the contract period or as the Company completes its service obligations for the services provided to third-party non-insureds.\nOther Revenues\nOther revenues include revenues from premium installment charges, which are recognized as collected, gains and losses on dispositions of assets and redemption of debt, and other miscellaneous revenues, including gains recognized as a result of settlements of reinsurance disputes and claim-related legal matters.\nOther revenues also include revenues from noninsurance subsidiaries (other than fee income) for insurance-related services and on-line insurance brokerage services and is recognized as the service is provided to the customer."

      "ground_truth": "The reference information explains that ceded premiums are treated as an expense in the income statement. Specifically, they are charged to income over the term of the various reinsurance contracts. This means that the premiums paid to reinsurers are recognized gradually, reducing the net premiums written and, consequently, influencing the company’s overall underwriting results and net income. On the balance sheet, any portion of these premiums that is unexpired—referred to as prepaid reinsurance premiums—is reported as an asset under ceded unearned premiums. In effect, while the recognition of ceded premiums over time impacts net income gradually, the prepaid balance ensures that only the portion of the premium that has “expired” contributes to current period expense, with the rest recorded on the balance sheet for future recognition.\n\nRegarding risk profile, the use of reinsurance arrangements helps the company mitigate exposure to insurance risks. By ceding a portion of the premiums (and therefore the associated risk) to reinsurers, the insurer reduces the potential impact of large or unexpected losses. However, the extent of this risk mitigation depends on the specific terms of the reinsurance contracts. Overall, transferring risk via reinsurance helps stabilize net income by reducing volatility from underwriting losses and enhances the company’s overall risk profile by limiting the exposure from high-severity claims."

      "ground_truth": "The provided reference gives a qualitative overview of NXP’s competitive environment which allows us to discuss specific challenges and opportunities, as well as implications for future capital allocation. NXP faces several challenges, including:\n\n1. **Intense Competition**: Competing with well-established players like Analog Devices Inc., Broadcom Inc., and Texas Instruments Inc., which have extensive investments in research and development, manufacturing, and sales. These competitors often specialize in specific applications or segments, thereby pressuring NXP to continue broadening its product portfolio and maintain its technological edge.\n\n2. **Rapid Technological Evolution**: The need to continuously innovate and develop new products to meet rapidly changing customer demands in terms of features, quality, performance, and cost. This challenge is intensified by competitors who may focus on single segments, enabling them to potentially outpace broader competitors in specific areas.\n\n3. **Integrated System Solutions**: As customers increasingly seek full system capabilities (which involve multiple devices and enabling software), NXP must leverage its in-depth application knowledge and system integration expertise to deliver comprehensive solutions. Maintaining these competencies in the face of competition requires ongoing investment in specialized human capital and development resources.\n\nOn the opportunity side, NXP can benefit from the following:\n\n1. **Broad Market Footprint**: While some competitors narrow their focus on specific segments, NXP’s diversified product lineup across multiple end markets can be leveraged to capture a broader customer base, reduce dependency on any single market segment, and create cross-selling opportunities for integrated system solutions.\n\n2. **Leveraging Scale and Innovation**: By investing in new product development and the underlying intellectual property, NXP can differentiate its offerings. Its approach to delivering full system capabilities (integrating multiple NXP devices with software) is a unique selling point that can be further built upon.\n\n3. **Strategic Capital Allocation**: The pressure from competitors is likely to drive NXP to allocate more capital toward accelerating R&D initiatives and expanding its production capacity, particularly in markets with high growth potential. There could also be an increased focus on strategic partnerships and potential acquisitions to strengthen its technological and market positions.\n\nIn summary, the competitive pressure from focused and well-resourced competitors is expected to result in a proactive capital allocation strategy at NXP. This means increased investments in R&D, innovation, and system-level integration capabilities, along with potential capacity expansions, in order to sustain and grow market share over time. While the reference does not provide quantitative financial data or specific calculations, this strategic analysis captures the qualitative factors that are likely to influence NXP's future capital decisions."

We believe that the amount of losses or any estimable range of possible losses with respect to these other matters will not, either individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe ultimate outcome of the legal and related matters described in this section, such as whether the likelihood of loss is remote, reasonably possible, or probable, or if and when the reasonably possible range of loss is estimable, is inherently uncertain. Therefore, if one or more of these matters were resolved against us for amounts in excess of management's estimates of loss, our results of operations and financial condition, including in a particular reporting period in which any such outcome becomes probable and estimable, could be materially adversely affected."

First, the acknowledgment that there is a reasonable possibility of incurring losses—even if the amounts are not immediately quantifiable—indicates that the risk profile of the company could be higher. This higher risk can lead to a risk premium adjustment when valuing the company, with investors potentially applying a higher discount rate. A higher discount rate would, in turn, lower the present value of expected future cash flows, potentially leading to a lower valuation.\n\nSecond, when capital is being allocated, management must account for possible cash outflows due to legal or regulatory settlements. Even if losses are not quantifiable in the short term, the possibility of future liabilities may prompt more conservative capital allocation decisions. For instance, the company might opt to allocate more capital towards building liquidity reserves or hedging risk rather than funding aggressive expansion or high-growth projects. Such strategic reallocation can affect not only the risk profile but also growth prospects.\n\nFinally, the disclosure also signals that, while there are uncertainties, management believes that individual or even aggregate losses will not materially affect the overall financial condition. This can provide some reassurance to investors and might moderate the impact on valuation. However, in periods of increased regulatory scrutiny or if one or more legal matters materialize beyond expectations, there could be significant downside pressure on both valuation and capital distribution strategies.\n\nIn summary, the uncertainty reflected in legal and regulatory risks introduces additional risk factors that are incorporated into valuation models via risk premiums and discount rates. It also influences capital allocation by prompting a more conservative management approach in preserving financial stability against potential unforeseen losses."

      "reference": [
        "Cybersecurity Strategy and Risk Management\nDanaher’s cybersecurity strategy and risk management program focuses on maintaining a secure environment for our data that complies with applicable legal requirements and effectively supports our business objectives and customer needs. Our commitment to cybersecurity emphasizes cultivation of a security-minded culture through education and training, and a programmatic and layered approach to prevention and detection of, and response to, cybersecurity threats. Key elements of our program for assessing, identifying and managing material risks from cybersecurity threats are described below.\nWe maintain cybersecurity policies that articulate Danaher’s expectations and requirements with respect to topics such as acceptable use of technology and data, data privacy, risk management, education and awareness and event and incident management. We regularly conduct exercises, with the support of outside domain experts, to improve the effectiveness of our processes and we periodically assess our processes against recognized cybersecurity frameworks. Consistent with our position that cybersecurity is the responsibility of every Danaher associate, we regularly educate and share best practices with our associates to raise awareness of cybersecurity threats. Every year, associates in applicable job categories are required to take information security and protection training as part of the Danaher Annual Training Program. We also conduct regular education and training for our associates through cyber-event simulations.\nWe strive to implement and maintain layered controls designed to prevent and, where necessary, detect and respond to cybersecurity threats. Our physical controls are designed to restrict access to locations that house significant physical information technology assets. Our technical preventive controls include access restrictions and network security technologies. Our notification policies and processes are designed so that notifications and alerts are escalated to the appropriate personnel on a timely basis to support effective review, response and compliance with legal requirements. In addition to event-specific notifications, data is aggregated and compiled on a regular basis to support the identification of trends and effective program review and oversight. We also recognize that Danaher is exposed to cybersecurity risks that affect third parties whom we rely on to process, store or transmit our electronic information. To manage these risks, we maintain technical security controls as well as processes designed to facilitate Danaher’s identification of third-party cybersecurity risks.\nKey elements of Danaher’s annual Enterprise Risk Management (“ERM”) program include an inventory and classification of key risk areas and topics; a methodology for scoring risks based on the risk’s probability, severity and velocity of impact, and for trending key risks; and a framework for developing and implementing countermeasures for key risks. Information technology/cybersecurity is one of five topical areas required to be addressed as part of the annual ERM program. IT and cybersecurity risks are required to be scored using the same methodology applied to all other risk categories, which facilitates an evaluation of the significance and prioritization of cyber-related risks relative to wider business risks. In addition, Danaher policy requires the reporting of certain cybersecurity incident data to Danaher’s Risk Committee (comprising senior members of the legal, finance, internal audit and compliance functions) for consideration as part of the ERM process. Members of the Danaher Risk Committee present annually to the Danaher Board of Directors a report on the results of the ERM process, including with respect to information technology and cybersecurity risks. As part of our cybersecurity risk management program, we also maintain cyber insurance in amounts and subject to coverage terms that are typical for companies of our type and size, however, such insurance may not be sufficient in type or amount to cover us against claims related to security breaches, cyber-attacks and other related breaches.\nWe periodically engage external consultants to assess our cybersecurity program. In addition, management’s annual assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting assesses the effectiveness of certain controls relating to cybersecurity, and the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm audits the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Cybersecurity Governance and Oversight\nAt the management level, Danaher’s cybersecurity program is led by the Company’s Chief Information Security Officer (“CISO”), who reports to Danaher’s Chief Information Officer (“CIO”), who in turn reports to Danaher’s Chief Financial Officer. Danaher’s CIO has served as a technology leader for over 25 years, leading cybersecurity, engineering, and operational functions as the CIO for two multi-billion dollar businesses prior to assuming the Danaher CIO role. Danaher’s CISO has served for more than 20 years in various information security roles, including serving as the Chief Information Security Officer of two large, publicly-traded companies prior to joining Danaher. The CISO is supported by the Information Risk Steering Committee (“IRSC”), a management committee comprising senior members of the information technology, legal, privacy, finance, internal audit and communications functions. The IRSC supports the CISO and CIO in overseeing and managing information security risks and in the event of a cybersecurity incident provides oversight and leadership with respect to incident investigation, mitigation and remediation.\nAt the Board level, Danaher’s Board of Directors has delegated to the Audit Committee of the Board responsibility for oversight of risks relating to cybersecurity, as set forth in the Committee’s charter. Multiple members of Danaher’s Audit Committee have prior work experience overseeing or assessing a cybersecurity function. Danaher’s CISO and CIO update the Audit Committee multiple times per year regarding Danaher’s cybersecurity program, including key program metrics, initiatives and developments. The Audit Committee regularly briefs the full Board on these matters. In addition, in the event of a significant cybersecurity incident, Danaher policy and process requires timely engagement of and consultation with the Audit Committee.\nBased on the information we have as of the date of this Annual Report, we do not believe any risks from cybersecurity threats, including as a result of any previous cybersecurity incidents, have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect Danaher, including our business strategy, results of operations or financial condition."

      "ground_truth": "The information provided clearly outlines how cybersecurity is integrated into Danaher’s broader Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) framework, contributing to both its risk profile and financial stability in several key ways. First, by incorporating cybersecurity risks into the overall ERM process, Danaher can score these risks using the same methodology applied to all other risk categories. This standardization helps in the accurate assessment, prioritization, and management of risks, ensuring that cyber-related vulnerabilities are considered in the context of the company’s wider risk exposure.\n\nSecond, regular aggregation and trend analysis of cybersecurity data enable early detection of potential threats and more effective countermeasure implementation. This proactive approach minimizes the likelihood of severe operational or financial impacts from potential cyber incidents.\n\nThird, the layered controls, both technical and physical, and the comprehensive risk management process—supported by internal committees such as the Information Risk Steering Committee and oversight by the Audit Committee at the board level—promote strong governance. This structure enhances accountability and ensures that cybersecurity risks are managed with appropriate attention, thus maintaining investor and market confidence.\n\nAdditionally, regular cybersecurity training of employees and engagement with third-party experts fortify the company’s internal defenses, reducing exposure to risks that could otherwise lead to significant financial losses. Even though insurance is maintained, the emphasis on internal risk management and control minimizes reliance on insurance to cover potential cyber incidents.\n\nOverall, the integration of cybersecurity within Danaher’s ERM framework not only provides a unified view of risk across the organization but also promotes a disciplined, proactive approach to risk management. This, in turn, bolsters financial stability by mitigating potential losses, safeguarding operational continuity, and reinforcing the company’s reputation and long-term financial resilience."

This purchase is made under the reauthorized $500 million share repurchase program. In percentage terms, the December repurchase represents roughly 8% of the total available authorization. Given that a large portion of the authorized repurchase amount (approximately $460 million) remains unused after December, it indicates that management is exercising caution. They are selectively buying shares at what they consider attractive prices rather than aggressively deploying the full repurchase authorization. This measured approach could suggest that while management sees value at the current or near‐current share price, they are also keeping the option open to capitalize on a more favorable valuation if it arises in the future."

      "reference": [
        "The description in this section reflects GE’s approach as of December 31, 2023; we anticipate that, following the planned spin-off of our GE Vernova businesses, each of GE Aerospace and GE Vernova will continue to evolve their cybersecurity risk management, strategies and governance to meet their respective needs as standalone companies.\n\nCYBERSECURITY RISK MANAGEMENT AND STRATEGY. GE has developed and implemented a cybersecurity framework intended to assess, identify and manage risks from threats to the security of our information, systems, products and network using a risk-based approach. The framework is informed in part by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework and International Organization for Standardization 27001 (ISO 27001) Framework, although this does not imply that we meet all technical standards, specifications or requirements under the NIST or ISO 27001.\n Our key cybersecurity processes include the following:\n•Risk-based controls for information systems and information on GE’s networks: We seek to maintain an information technology infrastructure that implements physical, administrative and technical controls that are calibrated based on risk and designed to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our information systems and information stored on GE’s networks, including customer information, personal information, intellectual property and proprietary information.\n•Cybersecurity incident response plan and testing: We have a cybersecurity incident response plan and dedicated teams to respond to cybersecurity incidents. When a cybersecurity incident occurs or we identify a vulnerability, we have cross-functional teams that are responsible for leading the initial assessment of priority and severity, and external experts may also be engaged as appropriate. GE’s cybersecurity teams assist in responding to incidents depending on severity levels and seek to improve our cybersecurity incident management plan through periodic tabletops or simulations at the enterprise and business levels.\n•Training: We provide security awareness training to help our employees understand their information protection and cybersecurity responsibilities at GE. We also provide additional role-based training to some employees based on customer requirements, regulatory obligations and industry risks.\n•Supplier risk assessments: We have implemented a third-party risk management process that includes expectations regarding information and cybersecurity. That process, among other things, provides for GE to perform cybersecurity assessments on certain suppliers based on an assessment of their risk profile and a related rating process. GE also seeks contractual commitments from key suppliers to appropriately secure and maintain their information technology systems and protect GE information that is processed on their systems.\n•Third-party assessments of GE: We have third-party cybersecurity companies engaged to periodically assess GE’s cybersecurity posture, to assist in identifying and remediating risks from cybersecurity threats.\n\nWe also consider cybersecurity, along with other top risks for GE, within our enterprise risk management framework. The enterprise risk management framework includes internal reporting at the business and enterprise levels, with consideration of key risk indicators, trends and countermeasures for cybersecurity and other types of significant risks. In the last fiscal year, we have not identified risks from known cybersecurity threats, including as a result of any prior cybersecurity incidents, that have materially affected us, including our operations, business strategy, results of operations, cash flow or financial condition. We face certain ongoing risks from cybersecurity threats—including heightened threats in connection with the separation of GE HealthCare in January 2023 and the planned separation of GE Aerospace and GE Vernova into independent companies—that, if realized, are reasonably likely to materially affect us, including our operations, business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition. Refer to the Risk Factors section (Cybersecurity - Increased cybersecurity requirements, vulnerabilities, threats and more sophisticated and targeted computer crime, as well as cybersecurity failures, pose risk to our systems, networks, products, solutions, services and data..) for additional information about these risks.\n\nCYBERSECURITY GOVERNANCE. The Audit Committee of the GE Board of Directors is responsible for board-level oversight of cybersecurity risk, and the Audit Committee reports back to the full Board about this and other areas within its responsibility. As part of its oversight role, the Audit Committee receives reporting about GE’s practices, programs, notable threats or incidents and other developments related to cybersecurity throughout the year, including through periodic updates from GE’s Global Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) and other internal digital technology and cybersecurity leaders on cyber threats and our cybersecurity risk management strategy. The Audit Committee also receives information about cybersecurity risks as part of GE’s enterprise risk management framework and reporting.\n\nGE’s Global CISO reports to GE’s Global Chief Information Officer and leads the Company’s overall cybersecurity function. The Global CISO has over 20 years of experience in managing and leading IT or cybersecurity teams and participates in various cyber security organizations. The Global CISO collaborates with business unit CISOs to identify and analyze cybersecurity risks to GE; consider industry trends; implement controls, as appropriate and feasible, to mitigate these risks; and enable business leaders to make risk-based business decisions that implicate cybersecurity considerations. The Global CISO meets with senior leadership to review and discuss GE’s cybersecurity program, including emerging cyber risks, threats and industry trends. The Global CISO also supervises efforts to prevent, detect, mitigate, and remediate cybersecurity risks and incidents through various means, including by collaborating with internal security personnel and business stakeholders, and incorporating threat intelligence and other information obtained from governmental, public or private sources to inform our cybersecurity technologies and processes."

This helps the company by:\n\n• Implementing risk-based controls: GE continuously assesses risks to its networks and systems and applies physical, administrative, and technical controls to safeguard the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of its data—including customer, personal, and proprietary information.\n\n• Establishing robust incident response: GE has a dedicated cybersecurity incident response plan, with cross-functional teams and external experts when needed, ensuring that any incidents are rapidly assessed and contained. Periodic tabletop exercises and simulations help improve response effectiveness.\n\n• Conducting regular training and supplier assessments: Ongoing security awareness and role-based training for employees reduce the risk of human error, while third-party risk management ensures that suppliers meet cybersecurity requirements, further reducing the exposure to cyber threats.\n\n• Utilizing third-party evaluations: The involvement of independent cybersecurity companies to assess GE’s posture ensures an external check on its security effectiveness, identifying potential vulnerabilities before they become financial liabilities.\n\n• Integrating cybersecurity into enterprise risk management: By including cyber risk in broader risk assessments and board-level oversight (via the Audit Committee and the Global CISO), GE ensures that cybersecurity is considered in strategic decision-making, potentially averting incidents that could materially affect operations or cash flow.\n\nTogether, these measures provide a multi-layered defense strategy that not only protects the integrity of their information systems but also minimizes the likelihood and potential financial impact of cyber incidents."

      "ground_truth": "The information provided on the board composition is useful for assessing several aspects of KLA Corporation’s governance and long-term operational performance. First, the presence of clearly defined roles such as President/CEO, CFO, and Chief Accounting Officer suggests that the company maintains a structured executive team that is likely to have strong oversight of both strategic initiatives and financial controls. A dedicated CEO and CFO, along with senior roles like the Chief Accounting Officer, indicate specialized attention to both operational performance and risk management.\n\nFurthermore, the roster includes multiple directors, some of whom appear to be independent (as suggested by the non-executive titles and separate signature lines). This diversity can enhance oversight by bringing various perspectives and expertise to board deliberations and help in challenging management decisions when necessary. Such a structure is a positive signal for long-term governance as it suggests that the board might balance strategic planning with prudent risk management.\n\nHowever, a potential challenge could be inferred if there is little separation between management and independent oversight. For example, if too many key positions are held by executive insiders, the board might risk groupthink or excessive alignment with short-term performance goals rather than long-term sustainability. The detailed signatory information allows analysts to scrutinize any clustering of roles (for example, a heavy reliance on executives who may be involved in day-to-day operations) and consider whether independent directors are positioned to exercise effective checks and balances.\n\nIn summary, the detailed board composition informs us that KLA Corporation benefits from clearly defined executive roles and the inclusion of multiple directors. These factors contribute to governance strengths by enhancing oversight, expertise, and strategic decision-making. Conversely, analysts should remain alert to potential challenges related to the balance of independence and whether the board’s structure is too closely tied to the executive management team, potentially affecting long-term operational prudence."

      "ground_truth": "The financial data provided allows us to infer key aspects of American Express Company’s liquidity strategy and capital structure management. In particular, the significant increase in customer deposits (for example, an increase of $18,915 million in 2023 compared to a decrease in 2021) indicates that the company is relying on its deposit base as a stable, low-cost source of funding. This inflow strengthens liquidity by providing a readily available pool of funds that can be used to grow operations and support lending without having to depend solely on external borrowings.\n\nIn addition, the changes in long-term debt show that American Express is actively managing its debt profile. In 2023, the company raised $15,674 million in long-term debt while repaying $10,703 million, resulting in a net increase in long-term borrowings of about $4,971 million. This demonstrates a deliberate approach to capital structure by balancing between raising funds through debt (to finance expansion and other capital needs) and maintaining sufficient repayment discipline to manage leverage levels.\n\nTogether, these financing activities suggest that American Express employs a dual strategy: leveraging customer deposits to provide liquidity and stability, while using prudent long-term borrowings to optimize its capital structure.

        "We compute earnings per share (EPS) of Class A and Class B common stock using the two-class method. As the liquidation and dividend rights for both Class A and Class B common stock are identical, the undistributed earnings are allocated on a proportionate basis to the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period.\n\nBasic EPS is computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of shares of our Class A and Class B common stock outstanding. For the calculation of diluted EPS, net income for basic EPS is adjusted by the effect of dilutive securities, including restricted stock units (RSUs) awards under our Equity Incentive Plan.\n\nIn addition, the computation of the diluted EPS of Class A common stock assumes the conversion of our Class B common stock to Class A common stock, while the diluted EPS of Class B common stock does not assume the conversion of those shares to Class A common stock. Diluted EPS is computed by dividing the resulting net income by the weighted-average number of fully diluted common shares outstanding.\n\nFor the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, approximately 16 million and 95 million shares of Class A common stock equivalents of RSUs were excluded from the diluted EPS calculation, respectively, as including them would have an anti-dilutive effect. RSUs with anti-dilutive effect were not material for the year ended December 31, 2021.\n\nBasic and diluted EPS are the same for each class of common stock because they are entitled to the same liquidation and dividend rights.\n\nThe numerators and denominators of the basic and diluted EPS computations for our common stock are calculated as follows (in millions, except per share amounts):\n \tYear Ended December 31,\n \t2023\t\t2022\t\t2021\n \tClass\nA\t\tClass\nB\t\tClass\nA\t\tClass\nB\t\tClass\nA\t\t\nClass\nB \nBasic EPS:\t \t\t \t\t \t\t \t\t \t\t \nNumerator\t \t\t \t\t \t\t \t\t \t\t \nNet income\t$\t33,722 \t\t\t$\t5,376 \t\t\t$\t19,729 \t\t\t$\t3,471 \t\t\t$\t33,328 \t\t\t$\t6,042 \t\nDenominator\t \t\t \t\t \t\t \t\t \t\t \nShares used in computation of basic earnings per share\t2,220 \t\t\t354 \t\t\t2,285 \t\t\t402 \t\t\t2,383 \t\t\t432 \t\nBasic EPS\t$\t15.19 \t\t\t$\t15.19 \t\t\t$\t8.63 \t\t\t$\t8.63 \t\t\t$\t13.99 \t\t\t$\t13.99 \t\nDiluted EPS:\t \t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \nNumerator\t \t\t \t\t \t\t \t\t \t\t \nNet income\t$\t33,722 \t\t\t$\t5,376 \t\t\t$\t19,729 \t\t\t$\t3,471 \t\t\t$\t33,328 \t\t\t$\t6,042 \t\nReallocation of net income as a result of conversion of Class B to Class A common stock\t5,376 \t\t\t— \t\t\t3,471 \t\t\t— \t\t\t6,042 \t\t\t— \t\nReallocation of net income to Class B common stock\t— \t\t\t(112)\t\t\t— \t\t\t(19)\t\t\t— \t\t\t(93)\t\nNet income for diluted EPS\t$\t39,098 \t\t\t$\t5,264 \t\t\t$\t23,200 \t\t\t$\t3,452 \t\t\t$\t39,370 \t\t\t$\t5,949 \t\nDenominator\t \t\t \t\t \t\t \t\t \t\t \nShares used in computation of basic earnings per share\t2,220 \t\t\t354 \t\t\t2,285 \t\t\t402 \t\t\t2,383 \t\t\t432 \t\nConversion of Class B to Class A common stock\t354 \t\t\t— \t\t\t402 \t\t\t— \t\t\t432 \t\t\t— \t\nWeighted-average effect of dilutive RSUs\t55 \t\t\t— \t\t\t15 \t\t\t— \t\t\t44 \t\t\t— \t\nShares used in computation of diluted earnings per share\t2,629 \t\t\t354 \t\t\t2,702 \t\t\t402 \t\t\t2,859 \t\t\t432 \t\nDiluted EPS\t$\t14.87 \t\t\t$\t14.87 \t\t\t$\t8.59 \t\t\t$\t8.59 \t\t\t$\t13.77 \t\t\t$\t13.77"

      "ground_truth": "The data provided offers enough detail to examine how the adjustments for diluted EPS – in particular, the reallocation of net income related to the conversion of Class B shares into Class A – affect the EPS metric over time. For instance, in 2023 the basic EPS for Class A is reported as $15.19 based on net income of $33.722 billion, but when the conversion adjustment of $5.376 billion is added (bringing the numerator to $39.098 billion) and the weighted‐average share count increases from 2,220 million to 2,629 million (because it includes the 354 million additional shares from Class B conversion and the 55 million effect from dilutive RSUs), the diluted EPS falls slightly to $14.87. A similar mechanism is seen in the prior years – net income is reallocated, and the share count is increased by including convertible instruments. This tells us several things about Meta Platforms’ financial health:\n\n1. The adjustments show that while total earnings are robust, the conversion of dilutive securities (like Class B shares and RSUs) increases the denominator (number of shares) enough to slightly lower the per‐share EPS. This is a signal that if all potential dilutive securities were converted, existing shareholders would receive a somewhat lower portion of the earnings even though the overall profitability remains high.\n\n2. The fact that there is an active mechanism for reallocation indicates that management is transparent about how different classes of stock share earnings, emphasizing that all common shares (despite different classes) ultimately participate in the same net income. However, the additional shares recognized in diluted EPS suggest a potential dilution risk and underline the importance of monitoring equity compensation and conversion events in capital allocation decisions.\n\n3. From a broader perspective, the relatively small differences between basic and diluted EPS in each period may imply that although there is a conversion effect, the dilutive impact of convertible securities (RSUs and Class B conversions) is not extreme. This points to sound profitability with a controlled level of dilution – a positive note for investors regarding Meta Platforms' financial stability.\n\nIn summary, the shifting composition of net income (due to conversion adjustments and the inclusion of dilutive securities) results in an increased net income figure for diluted EPS but also a higher share count, leading to a lower diluted EPS compared to the basic EPS. This dynamic provides insight into both the robust earnings generation of Meta Platforms and the potential dilution risk inherent in its capital structure. The company demonstrates healthy profitability, but investors should be aware of the effects of equity-based compensation and convertible securities when evaluating per-share earnings."

      "ground_truth": "The data clearly differentiate between debt instruments based on both their interest rate structures and their seniority, which in turn provides insights into Truist Financial Corporation’s risk profile and cash flow management. For example:\n\n1. Fixed vs. Floating Rate Instruments: \n   • The fixed rate notes (both senior and subordinated) have stated and effective rates that remain constant over time, which provides predictable interest expense and cash flow obligations regardless of market fluctuations. This predictability supports stable cash flow management. \n   • Meanwhile, floating rate notes have rates that adjust over time. Although their current effective rates are similar to the stated rates (indicating minimal adjustments at issuance), they inherently expose the company to interest rate risks. In rising rate environments, the cost of servicing floating rate debt would increase and affect cash flow, whereas falling rates offer a potential benefit.\n\n2. Senior vs. Subordinated Notes:\n   • Senior notes (both fixed and floating) generally have lower risk since they have priority in claims over assets in the event of bankruptcy. Their lower effective rates reflect this lower risk. Traders and investors typically demand lower yields on senior debt, indicating that these instruments have less impact on the overall risk profile.\n   • Subordinated notes, on the other hand, carry additional risk due to their lower ranking in claims. This higher risk is often reflected in slightly higher effective rates (e.g., the fixed rate subordinated notes) even if the stated rates appear modest. These instruments are riskier and can influence the risk profile, especially under stress conditions, and may also have an impact on the capital structure by contributing to supplementary Tier 2 capital under regulatory guidelines.\n\n3. Insights on Cash Flow Management and Market Conditions:\n   • In a rising interest rate environment, the company’s floating rate debt instruments are more sensitive, which could lead to increased cash flow outflows if market rates increase. On the other hand, fixed-rate debt protects the company from such market volatility but locks in a predetermined cost.\n   • The differentiation between stated and effective rates (with the effective rate incorporating adjustments such as issuance costs, hedging impacts, and other debt issuance adjustments) further refines analysis. Although the differences in the provided data are relatively small, they indicate that the company accounts for market and issuance dynamics, which in turn reflect on its broader risk management strategy.\n\nIn summary, by maintaining a mix of fixed versus floating rate, and senior versus subordinated debt, Truist Financial Corporation balances the need for predictable cash flow and low-cost capital with the flexibility (and associated risk) of taking advantage of favorable market conditions. This nuanced structuring of debt helps manage short-term liquidity risks while structuring the long-term cost of capital amidst changing market conditions."

Salon services revenue is recognized at the time the service is provided to the guest. Shipping and handling are treated as costs to fulfill the contract and not a separate performance obligation. Accordingly, the Company recognizes revenue for its single performance obligation related to e-commerce sales at the time control of the merchandise passes to the customer, which is at the time of shipment or guest pickup. The Company provides refunds for merchandise returns within 60 days from the original purchase date. State sales taxes are presented on a net basis as the Company considers itself a pass-through conduit for collecting and remitting state sales tax.

      "ground_truth": "Yes, the five-step revenue recognition process as outlined does provide insight into Ulta Beauty's control transfer mechanisms and highlights potential timing risks associated with recognizing revenue. Specifically: \n\n1. Identification of the Contract and Performance Obligations: By first identifying the contracts and unique performance obligations (e.g., retail merchandise, e-commerce merchandise, and salon services), the process confirms when control is expected to be transferred based on the type of transaction. \n\n2. Transaction Price Determination and Allocation: Allocating the transaction price to these obligations indicates how revenue is measured, and any uncertainties (such as estimated returns on merchandise sales or timing of service fulfillment) require careful assessment to ensure that revenue is recognized appropriately. \n\n3. Recognition of Revenue Based on Control Transfer: The timing of revenue recognition is tied to when control is transferred to the guest. For instance, retail sales are recognized at the point of sale, e-commerce revenue is recognized upon shipment or guest pickup, and salon services when the service is provided. This delineation provides insight into potential timing differences across channels. \n\n4. Timing Risks: The process explicitly mentions estimated returns (with a refund period of 60 days for merchandise) and coupons recorded as sales reductions, which both could introduce timing risks. For example, if significant returns occur after revenue has been initially recognized, this could affect the reporting of revenue in prior periods. \n\nOverall, the detailed description enables an evaluation of when control is considered transferred and thus when revenue is recognized, making it possible to assess the inherent timing risks associated with various revenue streams."

      "ground_truth": "The provided data gives a clear picture of Equinix’s debt-related commitments, including the $13.2 billion of senior notes principal. These obligations significantly increase the long-term liabilities on Equinix’s balance sheet, meaning that the company has a high level of leverage which must be managed over time. In practical terms, the senior notes increase the company’s fixed financial obligations through interest expense (notably, approximately $3.0 billion of interest on various debt instruments) and principal repayments, thereby impacting key metrics such as debt-to-equity and interest coverage ratios. Additionally, the data highlights other significant liabilities: term loans, lease commitments ($5.4 billion in total lease payments), and capital expenditure contractual commitments ($2.0 billion), all of which further contribute to the long-term obligations. However, Equinix also states that its sources of liquidity – including expected future operating cash flows – are robust enough to meet these near- and long-term commitments. This suggests that, while the increased debt can raise financing and refinancing risks, the current financial structure is designed to sustainably support these obligations. In summary, the $13.2 billion senior notes and related debt commitments add leverage and fixed cost pressures to Equinix’s balance sheet, but the company’s strong liquidity and operating cash flow generation appear well aligned to manage these risks over the long term."

        "Management assesses liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund operating, investing and financing activities. We continue to generate substantial cash from operating activities, remain in a strong financial position and manage our capital structure to meet short- and long-term objectives including reinvestment in existing businesses and completing strategic acquisitions.\n  \nFunds generated by operating activities, our $1.5 billion five-year unsecured revolving credit facility (the \"Revolver\") and related commercial paper (“CP”) program, more fully described below, are our most significant sources of liquidity. At December 31, 2023, we had $216.8 million in cash and cash equivalents, as well as $1,303.6 million available to borrow under our Revolver.\n\nSources and Uses of Cash\n\nWe believe that our existing cash balance, liquidity available from our CP and Revolver, cash generated from ongoing operations and continued access to public or private debt markets will be sufficient to satisfy cash requirements over the next 12 months and beyond. While there was no significant change in our cash requirements as of December 31, 2023 compared to December 31, 2022, we have utilized existing CP and Revolver capacity, together with cash from operating activities, to meet our current obligations. During the first quarter of 2023, we borrowed $175.0 million on our Revolver to pay down CP. We subsequently repaid the Revolver in full during the second quarter of 2023.\n\nFund Transfer Limitations.  The ability of certain of our subsidiaries and associated companies to transfer funds to the U.S may be limited, in some cases, by certain restrictions imposed by foreign governments. These restrictions do not, individually or in the aggregate, materially limit our ability to service our indebtedness, meet our current obligations or pay dividends. As of December 31, 2023, we held $180.0 million of cash in our foreign subsidiaries.\n\nInformation about our cash flows, by category, is presented in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

The company’s substantial operating cash flows—over $1.1 billion in 2023—highlight its ability to generate cash from core business operations. This significant cash generation is crucial because it not only funds day-to-day operating, investing, and financing activities but also allows Equifax to manage obligations such as debt servicing and potential reinvestment opportunities.\n\nAdditionally, Equifax’s access to a $1.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility and its commercial paper (CP) program provides an extra layer of liquidity. As of December 31, 2023, the company had $1,303.6 million available to borrow under the Revolver, which supplements its cash reserves (including $216.8 million in cash and equivalents and an additional $180 million held in foreign subsidiaries). This diversified liquidity approach means that even during periods of market volatility or operational challenges, Equifax can rely on its operating cash flows as well as external financing options to meet its short- and long-term obligations.\n\nIn terms of liquidity risk, the integration of robust cash flows with ample credit access reduces the likelihood of liquidity crunches. The company’s strategic management of its credit facilities—evidenced by the efficient use and subsequent repayment of the Revolver in 2023—further reinforces its financial resilience. Overall, Equifax’s framework minimizes liquidity risk and positions it well to navigate both current needs and future investment opportunities."

        "The Company recognizes sales for the amount of consideration collected from the member, which includes gross shipping fees where applicable, and is net of sales taxes collected and remitted to government agencies and member returns. The Company reserves for estimated returns based on historical trends in merchandise returns and reduces sales and merchandise costs accordingly. The Company records, on a gross basis, a refund liability and an asset for recovery, which are included in other current liabilities and other current assets, respectively, in the consolidated balance sheets.\nThe Company offers merchandise in the following core merchandise categories: foods and sundries, non-foods, and fresh foods. The Company also provides expanded products and services through warehouse ancillary and other businesses. The Company is the principal for the majority of its transactions and recognizes revenue on a gross basis. The Company is the principal when it has control of the merchandise or service before it is transferred to the member. The majority of revenue from merchandise sales is recognized at the point of sale. Revenue generated through e-commerce or special orders is generally recognized upon shipment to the member. For merchandise shipped directly to the member, shipping and handling costs are expensed as incurred as fulfillment costs and included in merchandise costs in the consolidated statements of income. In certain ancillary businesses, revenue is deferred until the member picks up merchandise at the warehouse. Deferred sales are included in other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.\nThe Company accounts for membership fee revenue, net of refunds, on a deferred basis, ratably over the one-year membership period. Deferred membership fees at the end of 2024 and 2023 were $2,501 and $2,337.\nIn most countries, the Company's Executive members qualify for a 2% reward on qualified purchases, subject to an annual maximum value, which does not expire and is redeemable at Costco warehouses. The Company accounts for this reward as a reduction in sales, net of the estimated impact of non-redemptions (breakage), with the corresponding liability classified as accrued member rewards in the consolidated balance sheets. Estimated breakage is computed based on redemption data. For 2024, 2023, and 2022, the net reduction in sales was $2,804, $2,576, and $2,307.\nThe Company sells and otherwise provides proprietary shop cards that do not expire and are redeemable at the warehouse or online for merchandise or membership. Revenue from shop cards is recognized upon redemption, and estimated breakage is recognized based on redemption data. The Company accounts for outstanding shop card balances as a shop card liability, net of estimated breakage. Shop card liabilities are included in other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.\nCitibank, N.A. is the exclusive issuer of co-branded credit cards to U.S. members. The Company receives various forms of consideration from Citibank, including a royalty on purchases made on the card outside of Costco. A portion of the royalty is used to fund the rebate that cardholders receive, after taking into consideration breakage, which is calculated based on rebate redemption data. The rebates are issued in February and expire on December 31. The Company also maintains co-branded credit card arrangements in Canada and certain other International subsidiaries."

      "ground_truth": "Costco’s role as the principal in most transactions gives the company direct control over when and how revenue is recognized, which has important implications for operational risk management and overall financial health. By acting as the primary entity in its transactions, Costco assumes the risks and rewards associated with the merchandise, allowing it to record revenue on a gross basis. This direct control means that the company is better positioned to manage inventory, pricing, and customer relations, thereby reducing uncertainty around the realization of revenue.\n\nIn addition, Costco’s approach to accounting for estimated returns—reserving for product returns based on historical trends—serves as a crucial risk management tool. By anticipating returns and adjusting both sales and merchandise costs accordingly, the company minimizes the risk of overstatement of revenues. This proactive estimation ensures that reported earnings more accurately reflect the risks inherent in its business, which in turn enhances credibility with investors and other stakeholders.\n\nThe deferral of certain revenues, such as membership fees or ancillary business sales that are only recognized when a certain action (like pickup in store) occurs, further contributes to operational stability. By deferring revenue recognition until the related performance obligations are satisfied, Costco aligns revenue with the timing of the actual service provided to the customer. This matching principle not only delivers a more accurate picture of current performance but also reduces the likelihood of revenue volatility and related operational risks.\n\nOverall, the combination of assuming the principal role in transactions, estimating returns, and deferring revenue recognition allows Costco to maintain tighter control over its financial reporting. It minimizes the risk of revenue misstatement, ensures that liabilities (such as refund liabilities and deferred sales) are properly recorded, and ultimately supports a more stable and transparent financial profile. This disciplined approach promotes operational consistency and contributes to the long‐term financial health of the business."

Revenue Growth Calculations:\n   - From 2022 to 2023: \n     • 2022 revenue: $5,709.1 million\n     • 2023 revenue: $6,060.9 million\n     • Growth = [(6,060.9 / 5,709.1) - 1] × 100 ≈ 6.15%\n   - From 2023 to 2024: \n     • 2023 revenue: $6,060.9 million\n     • 2024 revenue: $6,506.8 million\n     • Growth = [(6,506.8 / 6,060.9) - 1] × 100 ≈ 7.41%\n   - Overall Growth from 2022 to 2024 is roughly 14% cumulatively.\n\n2. Key Drivers Behind the Revenue Growth:\n   - Although the consolidated statement does not provide a detailed breakdown by segment or geographic market, a few inferences can be made:\n     • Increased Client Adoption: Consistent revenue growth over the three years suggests that Broadridge’s core business—providing financial technology and securities processing services—is attracting new clients or enlarging its share with existing ones.\n     • Enhanced Service Offerings and Pricing: The improvement in operating income (rising from $759.9 million in 2022 to $1,017.1 million in 2024) implies that the company has either improved its pricing, enhanced its service mix, or achieved operational efficiencies, all of which can drive revenue growth.\n     • Broader Market Trends: While not directly visible in the numbers, the growth may also be supported by broader trends in digital financial services and regulatory requirements that enhance the need for the company’s solutions.\n\nIn summary, the year-over-year revenue growth has been steady, with approximately 6.15% growth from 2022 to 2023 and 7.41% from 2023 to 2024. This growth appears to be driven by increased adoption of Broadridge’s financial services and an improvement in operational efficiency, although more granular segment details would be needed for a more definitive causal analysis."

      "ground_truth": "The $7.42 billion of unused committed bank credit facilities serves as a significant liquidity buffer that enhances Eli Lilly and Company’s financial flexibility in several ways. First, these undrawn facilities can support the company’s commercial paper program by serving as a backstop for short‐term funding needs. In practice, should market conditions tighten or if there is an unexpected cash outflow, the company could draw on these facilities to finance commercial paper issuances, thereby ensuring continuous liquidity in the short term. This arrangement can help maintain favorable credit ratings and market confidence by minimizing the risk of liquidity shortfalls.\n\nSecondly, having an additional $7.42 billion available provides a cushion against unexpected operational challenges or shifts in market conditions, enabling the company to manage its working capital more efficiently. Even though the bulk of these facilities are tied to the commercial paper program (eg, through the primary $3.00 billion facility expiring in December 2027 and the $4.00 billion 364-day facility expiring in September 2024), their undrawn status signals financial strength and flexibility, allowing the firm to take advantage of growth or acquisition opportunities, if needed.\n\nOverall, this robust liquidity buffer reinforces the company's ability to meet short-term obligations without being forced into unfavorable borrowing conditions. The credit facilities essentially enable a more efficient capital structure, supporting both routine operations and strategic initiatives, ultimately cushioning the company against market volatility and improving its leverage and risk profile."

      "ground_truth": "The available $2.36 billion for share repurchases provides insight into how CarMax’s capital structure and investor returns might evolve. Here are the key points:\n\n1. Capital Structure Impact:\n   • Reduction in Equity: The repurchase program will reduce the company’s outstanding shares. This decrease in the equity base may improve metrics like Earnings Per Share (EPS) and can shift the capital structure by replacing cash (an asset) with treasury stock (a reduction in equity).\n   • Leverage Considerations: Paying out a significant amount of cash via buybacks may lower the overall cash reserves, potentially increasing the firm’s leverage ratio (debt-to-equity) if debt levels remain constant. This trade-off should be monitored as it might affect the company’s borrowing capacity and financial flexibility.\n\n2. Investor Returns:\n   • EPS Accretion: With fewer shares outstanding, the company’s net income is spread over a smaller base. This typically results in a higher EPS, which can be attractive to investors and may drive up the stock price.\n   • Shareholder Value Signal: A continued commitment to share repurchases can be interpreted as management’s confidence in the company’s valuation and future prospects. This signaling effect can enhance investor sentiment and potentially increase the stock’s market value.\n   • Return on Capital Allocation: When executed at attractive valuation levels (for instance, the historical average cost per share in fiscal 2024 was around $68.33, which is lower than previous years), repurchases can generate an efficient use of capital. This is because they may yield a higher return compared to alternative uses such as low-yielding investments or high-cost debt.\n\n3. Estimation Example (Simplified Calculation):\n   • If the company were to repurchase shares at an average cost similar to Q3 2024 (approximately $68.33 per share), the remaining $2.36 billion could acquire about 34.5 million shares (2,360,000,000 / 68.33 ≈ 34,525,000 shares). This significant reduction in outstanding shares can substantially boost per-share metrics.\n\nOverall, the continued share repurchase program, using the remaining $2.36 billion, is likely to drive EPS growth and enhance investor returns by reducing share count while also potentially increasing leverage. Investors should, however, consider the balance between the benefits of improved per-share metrics and the risks associated with reduced liquidity and increased leverage."

      "ground_truth": "The data provided indicates that Alliant Energy Corporation primarily relies on cash generated from electric and gas sales to IPL’s and WPL’s customers, and this has some important implications for its liquidity and operational risk. On the liquidity side, because these sales act as a steady source of cash that reimburses the company for prudently incurred expenses and supports a return on assets, the company benefits from a relatively stable and predictable inflow of funds. This stability helps maintain liquidity, ensuring that the company can cover its routine expenses and operating needs. However, a key point to note is that while these cash flows are dependable under normal market conditions, they are also tied closely to customer usage patterns and regulatory environments, which means any significant changes in consumer demand or regulatory policy could potentially disrupt this primary cash source.\n\nFrom an operational risk perspective, the heavy reliance on electric and gas sales means that Alliant Energy is exposed to industry-specific and regulatory risks. For example, if there were shifts in regulatory policies affecting rates or cost recovery mechanisms, or if there were unexpected changes in consumption behavior, the company might face challenges in meeting its expense reimbursements and financing new projects. Moreover, since the necessary capital for major strategic projects and debt retirement is expected to be sourced through external financings, any downturn in the primary cash flow could also affect the company's ability to access capital at favorable rates, thereby increasing its overall financial risk.\n\nIn summary, while the steady cash inflow from utility sales supports favorable liquidity by ensuring consistent cash availability, it also concentrates operational risk around the dependency on a regulated and potentially volatile market segment. This dual nature of the cash flow necessitates careful management of both pricing, regulatory engagement, and contingency planning for external financing."

      "ground_truth": "In 2023, the company’s operating income was derived by first combining the income from operations of its two reportable segments—Clear Aligner ($1,182 million) and Systems and Services ($191 million)—to get a total segment income from operations of about $1,373.6 million. From this combined figure, unallocated corporate expenses of approximately $730.3 million were subtracted, resulting in an overall operating income of about $643.3 million. This deduction is significant because it shows that a substantial portion of the segment-generated earnings is absorbed by corporate-level expenses that are not directly attributed to the specific segments.\n\nThe data also includes allocated stock-based compensation and depreciation and amortization. In 2023 the total stock-based compensation expense was approximately $154.0 million and total depreciation and amortization was about $142.4 million. Although these items are reported by segment and by corporate level (i.e. allocated across Clear Aligner, Systems and Services, and unallocated corporate expenses), they all represent operating costs that reduce operating income.\n\nExamining the evolution over the three-year period (2021 to 2023):\n\n1. Unallocated Corporate Expenses:\n   • 2021: $608.6 million\n   • 2022: $671.6 million\n   • 2023: $730.3 million\n   There is a steady increase over the period, which means that even if the segments’ earnings were stable or growing modestly, the higher allocation of corporate expenses has exerted increased downward pressure on overall operating income.\n\n2. Stock-Based Compensation (Total):\n   • 2021: $114.3 million\n   • 2022: $133.4 million\n   • 2023: $154.0 million\n   This expense has also been rising, suggesting that the company has either been granting more stock-based awards, has a higher per-unit expense (or both). This increase further reduces the profit margin from the segment earnings.\n\n3. Depreciation and Amortization (Total):\n   • 2021: $108.7 million\n   • 2022: $125.8 million\n   • 2023: $142.4 million\n   The progressive increase in depreciation and amortization reflects higher capital investment or an aging asset base where the expense is recorded, which again reduces the operating income over time.\n\nOverall, the allocated expenses (corporate expenses, stock-based compensation, and depreciation & amortization) worked to significantly lower the operating income relative to the raw segment income. Over the three-year period, all these allocated charges have trended upward, contributing to the decline in overall operating income from approximately $976.4 million in 2021 to $643.3 million in 2023, even though the combined segment earnings did not decline at the same pace. This demonstrates that higher allocation of centrally incurred costs and non-cash expenses have played a key role in the company’s operating performance evolution."

      "ground_truth": "The available information on the executives’ backgrounds allows us to qualitatively assess their potential influence on operational efficiency and profitability across Honeywell's various segments. For example:\n\n1. **Diverse Industry Experience**: Lucian Boldea’s extensive history in industrial automation and performance materials, combined with Jim Currier’s leadership in aerospace, and Kevin Dehoff’s experience in strategic business transformations (including his tenure at a consulting firm like McKinsey), indicates that each executive brings unique perspectives. This diversity can foster cross‐segment learning and the adoption of best practices that enhance operational efficiency by integrating innovations from different fields.\n\n2. **Strategic and Operational Improvements**: Boldea’s leadership background, with roles that required navigating sector-specific challenges across different segments (industrial automation and performance materials), suggests he could drive synergistic initiatives that streamline operations across divisions. Similarly, Dehoff’s experience in performance excellence and restructuring initiatives can lead to cost reduction and improved margins, thereby positively impacting profitability. Jim Currier’s background in aerospace, which typically demands high precision and regulatory compliance, may contribute to refining processes that not only increase efficiency in that segment but also serve as models for other divisions.\n\n3. **Risk Management and Capital Allocation**: A varied leadership team can enhance risk assessment by incorporating different perspectives on market volatility and capital needs. This can improve decision-making on investments in technology, process optimization, or market expansion initiatives, which are essential for maintaining profitability in a complex, multi-segment organization.\n\n4. **Innovation and Competitive Positioning**: The blend of expertise from different industries helps in challenging conventional practices and may promote innovation. This lessens operational inertia and might lead to the identification of new revenue opportunities or the implementation of cost-effective, scalable technologies that further optimize the company’s operations.\n\nWhile these insights do not directly substitute for quantitative financial analysis or specific performance metrics, the qualitative context implies that the diverse leadership backgrounds of Boldea, Dehoff, and Currier are likely to foster operational efficiencies and drive profitability improvements across Honeywell’s business segments."

      "reference": [
        "Linde plc is a public limited company formed under the laws of Ireland with its principal offices in the United Kingdom and United States. Linde is the largest industrial gas company worldwide and is a major technological innovator in the industrial gases industry. Its primary products in its industrial gases business are atmospheric gases (oxygen, nitrogen, argon, and rare gases) and process gases (carbon dioxide, helium, hydrogen, electronic gases, specialty gases, and acetylene etc). The company also designs and builds equipment that produces industrial gases and offers customers a wide range of gas production and processing services such as olefin plants, natural gas plants, air separation plants, hydrogen and synthesis gas plants and other types of plants.\nLinde serves a diverse group of industries including healthcare, chemicals and energy, manufacturing, metals and mining, food and beverage, and electronics.\nLinde’s sales were $32,854 million, $33,364 million, and $30,793 million for 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. Refer to Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis, for a discussion of consolidated sales and Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information related to Linde’s reportable segments.\nIndustrial Gases Products and Manufacturing Processes\nAtmospheric gases are the highest volume products produced by Linde. Using air as its raw material, Linde produces oxygen, nitrogen and argon through several air separation processes of which cryogenic air separation is the most prevalent. Rare gases, such as krypton, neon and xenon, are also produced through cryogenic air separation. As a pioneer in the industrial gases industry, Linde is a leader in developing a wide range of proprietary and patented applications and supply systems technology. Linde also led the development and commercialization of non-cryogenic air separation technologies for the production of industrial gases. These technologies open important new markets and optimize production capacity for the company by lowering the cost of supplying industrial gases. These technologies include proprietary vacuum pressure swing adsorption (“VPSA”) and membrane separation to produce gaseous oxygen and nitrogen, respectively.\nProcess gases, including carbon dioxide, hydrogen, helium, specialty gases and acetylene are produced by methods other than air separation.\nHydrogen is produced from a range of feedstocks using an array of different technologies. Despite hydrogen being an invisible molecule, colors are often used to designate and differentiate between the production processes used to produce the molecule. The majority of hydrogen currently produced by Linde is what is termed gray hydrogen and is derived from natural gas or methane, using steam methane reformation technology. Linde has multiple technologies to produce blue and green hydrogen, which are both considered types of clean energy. Blue hydrogen is produced by capturing the carbon emissions from the hydrogen plant and either utilizing them in a way that stops them from being emitted or sequestering them in the subsurface for the long term. Green hydrogen is produced by electrolysis using renewable energy or from the steam methane reforming of biomethane. Low carbon intensity, high-purity hydrogen is also produced by purifying and recovering by-product hydrogen sources from the chemical and petrochemical industries.\n\nCarbon monoxide can be produced by either steam methane reforming or auto-thermal reforming of natural gas or other feed streams such as naphtha. Most carbon dioxide is purchased from by-product sources, including chemical plants, refineries and industrial processes or is recovered from carbon dioxide wells. Carbon dioxide is processed in Linde’s plants to produce commercial and food-grade carbon dioxide. Helium is sourced from certain helium-rich natural gas streams in the United States, with additional supplies being acquired from outside the United States. Acetylene is primarily sourced as a chemical by-product, but may also be produced from calcium carbide and water.\n\nIndustrial Gases Distribution\nThere are three basic distribution methods for industrial gases: (i) on-site or tonnage; (ii) merchant or bulk liquid; and (iii) packaged or cylinder gases. These distribution methods are often integrated, with products from all three supply modes coming from the same plant. The method of supply is generally determined by the lowest cost means of meeting the customer’s needs, depending upon factors such as volume requirements, purity, pattern of usage, and the form in which the product is used (as a gas or as a cryogenic liquid).\nOn-site. Customers that require the largest volumes of product (typically oxygen, nitrogen and hydrogen) and that have a relatively constant demand pattern are supplied by cryogenic and process gas on-site plants. Linde constructs plants on or adjacent to these customers’ sites and supplies the product directly to customers by pipeline. On-site product supply contracts generally are total requirement contracts with terms typically ranging from 10-20 years and containing minimum purchase requirements and price escalation provisions. Many of the cryogenic on-site plants also produce liquid products for the merchant market. Therefore, plants are typically not dedicated to a single customer. Advanced air separation processes allow on-site delivery to customers with smaller volume requirements.\nMerchant. The merchant business is generally associated with distributable liquid oxygen, nitrogen, argon, carbon dioxide, hydrogen and helium. The deliveries generally are made from Linde’s plants by tanker trucks to storage containers at the customer's site which are usually owned and maintained by Linde and leased to the customer. Due to distribution cost, merchant oxygen and nitrogen generally have a relatively small distribution radius from the plants at which they are produced. Merchant argon, hydrogen and helium can be shipped much longer distances. The customer agreements used in the merchant business are usually three to seven-year requirement contracts.\nPackaged Gases. Customers requiring small volumes are supplied products in metal containers called cylinders, under medium to high pressure. Packaged gases include atmospheric gases, carbon dioxide, hydrogen, helium, acetylene and related products. Linde also produces and distributes in cylinders a wide range of specialty gases and mixtures. Cylinders may be delivered to the customer’s site or picked up by the customer at a packaging facility or retail store. Packaged gases are generally sold under one to three-year supply contracts and through purchase orders.\nEngineering\nLinde’s Engineering business has a global presence, with its focus on market segments such as air separation, hydrogen, synthesis, olefin and natural gas plants. The company utilizes its extensive process engineering know-how in the planning, design and construction of highly efficient plants for the production and processing of gases. With its state-of-the-art sustainable technologies Engineering also helps customers avoid, capture and utilize CO2 emissions. Its technology portfolio covers the entire value chain for production, liquefaction, storage, distribution and application of hydrogen which supports the transition to clean energy. Its digital services and solutions increase plant efficiency and performance.\n\nLinde's plants are used in a wide variety of fields: in the petrochemical and chemical industries, in refineries and fertilizer plants, to recover air gases, to produce synthesis gases, to treat natural gas and to produce noble gases. The Engineering business either supplies plant components directly to the customer or to the industrial gas business of Linde which operates the plants under a long-term gases supply contract.\n\nInventories – Linde carries inventories of merchant and cylinder gases and hardgoods to supply products to its customers on a reasonable delivery schedule. On-site plants and pipeline complexes have limited inventory. Inventory obsolescence is not material to Linde’s business.\n\nCustomers – Linde is not dependent upon a single customer or a few customers.\n\nInternational – Linde is a global enterprise with approximately 68% of its 2023 sales outside of the United States. The company also has majority or wholly owned subsidiaries that operate in approximately 45 European, Middle Eastern and African countries (including Germany, the United Kingdom (U.K.), France, Sweden, and the Republic of South Africa); approximately 20 Asian and South Pacific countries (including China, Australia, India, South Korea and Thailand); and approximately 20 countries in North and South America (including Canada, Mexico and Brazil).\nThe company also has equity method investments operating in Europe, Asia, and the Middle East.\nLinde’s non-U.S. business is subject to risks customarily encountered in non-U.S. operations, including fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, import and export controls, and other economic, political and regulatory policies of local governments. Also, see Item 1A. “Risk Factors” and Item 7A. “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.”\nSeasonality – Linde’s business is generally not subject to seasonal fluctuations to any significant extent.\nResearch and Development – Linde’s research and development is directed toward development of gas processing, separation and liquefaction technologies, and clean energy technologies; improving distribution of industrial gases and the development of new markets and applications for these gases. This results in the development of new advanced air separation, hydrogen, synthesis gas, natural gas, adsorption and chemical process technologies; novel clean energy and carbon management solutions; as well as the frequent introduction of new industrial gas applications. Research and development is primarily conducted in Pullach, Germany, Tonawanda, New York, Burr Ridge, Illinois and Shanghai, China. Patents and Trademarks – Linde owns or licenses a large number of patents that relate to a wide variety of products and processes. Linde’s patents expire at various times over the next 20 years. While these patents and licenses are considered important to its individual businesses, Linde does not consider its business as a whole to be materially dependent upon any one particular patent, or patent license, or family of patents. Linde also owns a large number of trademarks, of which the \"Linde\" trademark is the most significant.\nRaw Materials and Energy Costs – Energy is the single largest cost item in the production and distribution of industrial gases. Most of Linde’s energy requirements are in the form of electricity, natural gas and diesel fuel for distribution. The company mitigates electricity, natural gas, and hydrocarbon price fluctuations contractually through pricing formulas, surcharges, cost pass–through and tolling arrangements.\nThe supply of energy has not typically been a significant issue in the geographic areas where the company conducts business. However, energy availability and price is unpredictable and may pose future risks.\nFor carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, helium, hydrogen and specialty gases, raw materials are largely purchased from outside sources. Linde has contracts or commitments for, or readily available sources of, most of these raw materials; however, their long-term availability and prices are subject to market conditions.\nCompetition – Linde participates in highly competitive markets in industrial gases and engineering, which are characterized by a mixture of local, regional and global players, all of which exert competitive pressure on the parties. In locations where Linde has pipeline networks, which enable the company to provide reliable and economic supply of products to larger customers, Linde derives a competitive advantage.\nCompetitors in the industrial gases industry include global and regional companies such as L’Air Liquide S.A., Air Products and Chemicals, Inc., Messer Group GmbH, Mitsubishi Chemical Holdings Corporation (through Taiyo Nippon Sanso Corporation) as well as an extensive number of small to medium size independent industrial gas companies which compete locally as producers or distributors. In addition, a significant portion of the international gases market relates to customer-owned plants.\n\nEmployees – The company sources talent from an ever-changing and competitive environment. The ability to source and retain qualified and committed employees is a prerequisite for the company’s success, and represents a general risk for Linde.\n\nThe Board of Directors (\"Board\") has established a strategic business objective to maintain world-class standards in talent management. Executive variable compensation is assessed annually based on performance in financial measures as well as in several strategic non-financial areas, including talent management. The Human Capital Committee assists the Board in its oversight of Linde’s compensation policies and programs, particularly in regard to reviewing executive compensation for Linde’s executive officers. The Human Capital Committee also annually reviews the company’s management development and succession programs, diversity policies and objectives, and the associated programs to achieve those objectives. The global head of Human Resources reports to the Chief Executive Officer (\"CEO\"). A global leader of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion reports to the head of Human Resources.\nLinde has aligned diversity and inclusion with its business strategies and implemented diversity action planning into business process and performance management. Diversity, equity and inclusion are line management responsibilities and Linde seeks competitive advantage through proactive management of its talent pipeline and recruiting processes. Linde provides equal employment opportunity, and recruits, hires, promotes and compensates people based solely on their performance and ability.\nEmployees receive a competitive salary and variable compensation components based on performance and job level. Linde has collective bargaining agreements with unions at numerous locations throughout the world. Additional benefits are offered such as occupational pensions and contributions towards health insurance or medical screening, reflecting regional conditions and local competition. Senior managers participate directly in the company’s growth in value through the Long Term Incentive Plan of Linde plc. In addition, annually managers have the ability to grant leadership awards under the Long Term Incentive Plan to certain eligible employees. From time to time, Linde may introduce special compensation schemes to recognize or reward specific individuals such as the one implemented in 2020 for global front-line employees. Linde also invests in professional development of its employees through formal and on-the-job training.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, Linde had 66,323 employees worldwide comprised of approximately 28 percent women and 72 percent men. The total professional workforce is comprised of approximately 29 percent women and 71 percent men.\nEnvironment – Information required by this item is incorporated herein by reference to the section captioned “Management’s Discussion and Analysis – Environmental Matters” in Item 7 of this 10-K.\nAvailable Information – The company makes its periodic and current reports available, free of charge, on or through its website, www.linde.com, as soon as practicable after such material is electronically filed with, or furnished to, the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\").

This modest decline suggests that, based on these specific figures, the efficiency with which Amcor plc is turning its inventory into sales has slightly worsened.\n\nKey Insights:\n• A higher turnover ratio generally indicates better inventory management. In this case, the difference is marginal.\n• The small drop from 5.41 to 5.38 may not be significant on its own but could be considered alongside other operational metrics to fully gauge performance changes over time."

      "ground_truth": "The statement indicates that in 2023, investments did not mature to the same extent as in 2022, which meant that less cash was returned from these maturities. Typically, when investments mature, the cash proceeds from those investments are recorded as cash inflows in investing activities. However, in 2023, because of lower net maturities, the company received fewer cash inflows from its investments. This shortfall contributed to an overall increase in the net cash used in investing activities when compared to 2022. In essence, the lower net maturities reduced the cash available from investments that would have otherwise offset other cash outflows (such as those for business combinations), thereby enlarging the net use of cash in investing activities."

This indicates that the company transitioned from an overall loss to positive earnings over these years.\n• Although the margins remain thin, the upward trend suggests that Cardinal Health, Inc. has been successful in managing its costs and improving operational efficiencies relative to its revenue—a positive signal for overall profitability.\n• The improvement also may indicate that the company is benefiting from economies of scale or effective cost control measures, even as the margins themselves are relatively low. Investors should consider the context of such margins within the industry, as low margins might be common in high-volume, low-margin sectors, but the turnaround from loss to profit is nonetheless a positive development."

During fiscal year 2023, we repurchased 1,004,544 shares of common stock under the Repurchase Program for an aggregate cost of $131.3 million. No shares remain available for repurchase under the Repurchase Program due to its termination. During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2023, no shares of common stock were repurchased under the New Repurchase Program. During fiscal year 2023, we repurchased 2,159,985 shares of common stock under the New Repurchase Program for an aggregate cost of $244.6 million. As of December 31, 2023, $355.4 million remained available for aggregate repurchases of shares under the New Repurchase Program."

        "We are a party to litigation and other proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of our business, including matters arising under provisions relating to the protection of the environment, and are subject to contingencies related to certain businesses we previously owned. These types of matters could result in fines, penalties, cost reimbursements or contributions, compensatory or treble damages or non-monetary sanctions or relief. We believe the probability is remote that the outcome of each of these matters, including the legal proceedings described below, will have a material adverse effect on the company as a whole, notwithstanding that the unfavorable resolution of any matter may have a material effect on our net earnings and cash flows in any particular interim reporting period. Among the factors that we consider in this assessment are the nature of existing legal proceedings and claims, the asserted or possible damages or loss contingency (if estimable), the progress of the case, existing law and precedent, the opinions or views of legal counsel and other advisers, our experience in similar cases and the experience of other companies, the facts available to us at the time of assessment and how we intend to respond to the proceeding or claim. Our assessment of these factors may change over time as individual proceedings or claims progress.\nAlthough we cannot predict the outcome of legal or other proceedings with certainty, where there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss may have been incurred, GAAP requires us to disclose an estimate of the reasonably possible loss or range of loss or make a statement that such an estimate cannot be made. We follow a thorough process in which we seek to estimate the reasonably possible loss or range of loss, and only if we are unable to make such an estimate do we conclude and disclose that an estimate cannot be made. Accordingly, unless otherwise indicated below in our discussion of legal proceedings, a reasonably possible loss or range of loss associated with any individual legal proceeding cannot be estimated.\nUnited States of America, ex rel. Patzer; Cimma v. Sikorsky Aircraft Corp., et al.\nAs a result of our acquisition of Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation (Sikorsky), we assumed the defense of and any potential liability for two civil False Claims Act lawsuits pending in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin. In October 2014, the U.S. Government filed a complaint in intervention in the first suit, which was brought by qui tam relator Mary Patzer, a former Derco Aerospace (Derco) employee. In May 2017, the U.S. Government filed a complaint in intervention in a second suit, which was brought by qui tam relator Peter Cimma, a former Sikorsky Support Services, Inc. (SSSI) employee. In November 2017, the Court consolidated the cases into a single action for discovery and trial.\nThe U.S. Government alleges that Sikorsky and two of its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Derco and SSSI, violated the civil False Claims Act and the Truth in Negotiations Act in connection with a contract the U.S. Navy awarded to SSSI in June 2006 to support the Navy’s T-34 and T-44 fixed-wing turboprop training aircraft. SSSI subcontracted with Derco, primarily to procure and manage spare parts for the training aircraft. The U.S. Government contends that SSSI overbilled the Navy on the contract as the result of Derco’s use of prohibited cost-plus-percentage-of-cost (CPPC) pricing to add profit and overhead costs as a percentage of the price of the spare parts that Derco procured and then sold to SSSI. The U.S. Government also alleges that Derco’s claims to SSSI, SSSI’s claims to the Navy, and SSSI’s yearly Certificates of Final Indirect Costs from 2006 through 2012 were false and that SSSI submitted inaccurate cost or pricing data in violation of the Truth in Negotiations Act for a sole-sourced, follow-on “bridge” contract. The U.S. Government’s complaints assert common law claims for breach of contract and unjust enrichment. On November 29, 2021, the District Court granted the U.S. Government’s motion for partial summary judgment, finding that the Derco-SSSI agreement was a CPPC contract. On October 17, 2023, the District Court ruled on the parties’ cross motions for summary judgment, granting some motions and denying others. Trial on the U.S. Government’s remaining claims is scheduled for May 6, 2024.\nWe believe that we have legal and factual defenses to the U.S. Government’s remaining claims. The U.S. Government seeks damages of approximately $52 million, subject to trebling, plus statutory penalties. Although we continue to evaluate our liability and exposure, we do not currently believe that it is probable that we will incur a material loss. If, contrary to our expectations, the U.S. Government prevails on the remaining issues in this matter and proves damages at or near $52 million and is successful in having such damages trebled, the outcome could have an adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which a liability is recognized and on our cash flows for the period in which any damages are paid.\n\nLockheed Martin v. Metropolitan Transportation Authority\nOn April 24, 2009, we filed a declaratory judgment action against the New York Metropolitan Transportation Authority and its Capital Construction Company (collectively, the MTA) asking the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York to find that the MTA is in material breach of our agreement based on the MTA’s failure to provide access to sites where work must be performed and the customer-furnished equipment necessary to complete the contract. The MTA filed an answer and counterclaim alleging that we breached the contract and subsequently terminated the contract for alleged default. The primary damages sought by the MTA are the costs to complete the contract and potential re-procurement costs. While we are\n unable to estimate the cost of another contractor to complete the contract and the costs of re-procurement, we note that our contract with the MTA had a total value of $323 million, of which $241 million was paid to us, and that the MTA is seeking damages of approximately $190 million. We dispute the MTA’s allegations and are defending against them. Additionally, following an investigation, our sureties on a performance bond related to this matter, who were represented by independent counsel, concluded that the MTA’s termination of the contract was improper. Finally, our declaratory judgment action was later amended to include claims for monetary damages against the MTA of approximately $95 million. This matter was taken under submission by the District Court in December 2014, after a five-week bench trial and the filing of post-trial pleadings by the parties. We continue to await a decision from the District Court. Although this matter relates to our former Information Systems & Global Solutions (IS&GS) business, we retained responsibility for the litigation when we divested IS&GS in 2016."

      "ground_truth": "Management’s assessment of the potential loss from the ongoing U.S. Government litigation is based on several key assumptions. First, they evaluate the nature, progress, and specifics of the legal proceedings, including the claims being made and the types of damages sought. They rely on the current status of the litigation (such as the rulings on summary judgment motions) and the experience from similar cases, which together shape their expectation that a material adverse impact on the company overall is remote. Second, management considers the opinions of legal counsel and independent advisers regarding the likelihood of encountering significant losses, as well as comparisons with outcomes in similar litigation scenarios. Third, they factor in the estimated possible damages (which could be as high as $52 million, subject to trebling if the U.S. Government were successful) and the company’s capacity to manage and defend against such claims, while noting that any material loss would be recognized in the period in which it occurs and impact cash flows accordingly.\n\nA shift in these assumptions could adversely impact the company’s financial health. For instance, if unexpected legal developments or adverse rulings suggest that the probability or the magnitude of a loss is higher than initially assumed, the company might need to record a significant liability sooner than anticipated. This would result in a noticeable decrease in net earnings and could strain cash flows, impacting liquidity and capital allocation strategies. Moreover, changes in the legal environment, such as new evidence or changes in legal precedent, could compel management to revise their estimates—potentially leading to increased future provisions that would affect both the earnings and the risk profile of the company."
