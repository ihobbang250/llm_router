      "ground_truth": "The data provided allows us to identify several key factors that contributed to the more negative net cash used in investing activities in 2024. In 2024, the net cash used in investing activities was –$27,993K, compared to –$15,954K in 2023. A closer look at the components reveals:\n\n1. Increased Capital Expenditures: \n   • Purchases of property and equipment increased significantly to –$8,884K in 2024 (versus –$4,237K in 2023).\n   • A new line item appeared in 2024 for capitalized internal-use software costs, which was –$16,667K. This cost was not present in 2023 or 2022, adding new outflows.\n\n2. Investment in Marketable Securities:\n   • Although there were higher proceeds from sales of marketable securities in 2024 (+$15,930K) compared to 2023 (+$5,032K), the company also increased purchases of marketable securities (–$18,372K in 2024 versus –$10,623K in 2023). The net effect here was an overall increase in outflows despite the higher sales proceeds.\n\n3. Other Investing Activities:\n   • The absence of cash transfers related to product line asset sales in 2024 (as opposed to a cash outflow of –$6,126K in 2023) also affected the overall mix of investing cash flows.\n\nImpact on the Overall Investment Strategy:\n\n• The proceeds from the marketable securities sales, which increased markedly in 2024, suggest that the company is actively managing its investment portfolio to generate liquidity and possibly rebalance its investments. However, the higher purchases of marketable securities indicate that the company is reinvesting cash into short-term investments, which may be part of a strategy to maintain flexibility.\n\n• Simultaneously, the significant outflows for capital expenditures (including both property/equipment and internal-use software) imply that Fair Isaac Corporation is channeling cash toward long-term investments aimed at enhancing operational capabilities and future growth. This dual action of raising cash through securities sales while also reinvesting into core assets indicates a balanced approach to managing liquidity and pursuing growth opportunities.\n\nIn summary, the significant changes in net cash used in investing activities are primarily driven by increased capital expenditures and more aggressive positioning in marketable securities. The inflows from securities sales serve as a liquidity buffer that partially offsets these increased investments, highlighting a strategic effort to balance immediate cash needs with long-term growth investments."
