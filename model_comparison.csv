the volume/weather variance is primarily due to decreased usage during the unbilled sales period . see ""critical accounting estimates"" below and note 1 to the financial statements for further discussion of the accounting for unbilled revenues . the reserve equalization variance is primarily due to lower reserve equalization revenue related to changes in the entergy system generation mix compared to the same period in 2007 . the securitization transition charge variance is primarily due to the issuance of securitization bonds . in june 2007 , entergy gulf states reconstruction funding i , a company wholly-owned and consolidated by entergy texas , issued securitization bonds and with the proceeds purchased from entergy texas the transition property , which is the right to recover from customers through a transition charge amounts sufficient to service the securitization bonds . see note 5 to the financial statements for additional information regarding the securitization bonds . the fuel recovery variance is primarily due to a reserve for potential rate refunds made in the first quarter 2007 as a result of a puct ruling related to the application of past puct rulings addressing transition to competition in texas . the other variance is primarily caused by various operational effects of the jurisdictional separation on revenues and fuel and purchased power expenses . gross operating revenues , fuel and purchased power expenses , and other regulatory charges gross operating revenues increased $ 229.3 million primarily due to the following reasons : an increase of $ 157 million in fuel cost recovery revenues due to higher fuel rates and increased usage , partially offset by interim fuel refunds to customers for fuel cost recovery over-collections through november 2007 . the refund was distributed over a two-month period beginning february 2008 . the interim refund and the puct approval is discussed in note 2 to the financial statements ; an increase of $ 37.1 million in affiliated wholesale revenue primarily due to increases in the cost of energy ; an increase in transition charge amounts collected from customers to service the securitization bonds as discussed above . see note 5 to the financial statements for additional information regarding the securitization bonds ; and implementation of an interim surcharge to collect $ 10.3 million in under-recovered incremental purchased capacity costs incurred through july 2007 . the surcharge was collected over a two-month period beginning february 2008 . the incremental capacity recovery rider and puct approval is discussed in note 2 to the financial statements. .

Context: on a regular basis our special asset committee closely monitors loans , primarily commercial loans , that are not included in the nonperforming or accruing past due categories and for which we are uncertain about the borrower 2019s ability to comply with existing repayment terms . these loans totaled $ .2 billion at both december 31 , 2014 and december 31 , 2013 . home equity loan portfolio our home equity loan portfolio totaled $ 34.7 billion as of december 31 , 2014 , or 17% ( 17 % ) of the total loan portfolio . of that total , $ 20.4 billion , or 59% ( 59 % ) , was outstanding under primarily variable-rate home equity lines of credit and $ 14.3 billion , or 41% ( 41 % ) , consisted of closed-end home equity installment loans . approximately 3% ( 3 % ) of the home equity portfolio was on nonperforming status as of december 31 , 2014 . as of december 31 , 2014 , we are in an originated first lien position for approximately 51% ( 51 % ) of the total portfolio and , where originated as a second lien , we currently hold or service the first lien position for approximately an additional 2% ( 2 % ) of the portfolio . the remaining 47% ( 47 % ) of the portfolio was secured by second liens where we do not hold the first lien position . the credit performance of the majority of the home equity portfolio where we are in , hold or service the first lien position , is superior to the portion of the portfolio where we hold the second lien position but do not hold the first lien . lien position information is generally based upon original ltv at the time of origination . however , after origination pnc is not typically notified when a senior lien position that is not held by pnc is satisfied . therefore , information about the current lien status of junior lien loans is less readily available in cases where pnc does not also hold the senior lien . additionally , pnc is not typically notified when a junior lien position is added after origination of a pnc first lien . this updated information for both junior and senior liens must be obtained from external sources , and therefore , pnc has contracted with an industry-leading third-party service provider to obtain updated loan , lien and collateral data that is aggregated from public and private sources . we track borrower performance monthly , including obtaining original ltvs , updated fico scores at least quarterly , updated ltvs semi-annually , and other credit metrics at least quarterly , including the historical performance of any mortgage loans regardless of lien position that we do or do not hold . this information is used for internal reporting and risk management . for internal reporting and risk management we also segment the population into pools based on product type ( e.g. , home equity loans , brokered home equity loans , home equity lines of credit , brokered home equity lines of credit ) . as part of our overall risk analysis and monitoring , we segment the home equity portfolio based upon the delinquency , modification status and bankruptcy status of these loans , as well as the delinquency , modification status and bankruptcy status of any mortgage loan with the same borrower ( regardless of whether it is a first lien senior to our second lien ) . in establishing our alll for non-impaired loans , we primarily utilize a delinquency roll-rate methodology for pools of loans . in accordance with accounting principles , under this methodology , we establish our allowance based upon incurred losses , not lifetime expected losses . the roll-rate methodology estimates transition/roll of loan balances from one delinquency state ( e.g. , 30-59 days past due ) to another delinquency state ( e.g. , 60-89 days past due ) and ultimately to charge-off . the roll through to charge-off is based on pnc 2019s actual loss experience for each type of pool . each of our home equity pools contains both first and second liens . our experience has been that the ratio of first to second lien loans has been consistent over time and the charge-off amounts for the pools , used to establish our allowance , include losses on both first and second liens loans . generally , our variable-rate home equity lines of credit have either a seven or ten year draw period , followed by a 20-year amortization term . during the draw period , we have home equity lines of credit where borrowers pay either interest or principal and interest . we view home equity lines of credit where borrowers are paying principal and interest under the draw period as less risky than those where the borrowers are paying interest only , as these borrowers have a demonstrated ability to make some level of principal and interest payments . the risk associated with the borrower 2019s ability to satisfy the loan terms upon the draw period ending is considered in establishing our alll . based upon outstanding balances at december 31 , 2014 , the following table presents the periods when home equity lines of credit draw periods are scheduled to end . table 36 : home equity lines of credit 2013 draw period end in millions interest only product

the above table does not include orders for goods and services entered into in the normal course of business that are not enforceable or legally binding . item 7a . quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk . interest rate sensitivity our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio . the fair market value of fixed rate securities may be adversely impacted by fluctuations in interest rates while income earned on floating rate securities may decline as a result of decreases in interest rates . under our current policies , we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes . we attempt to ensure the safety and preservation of our invested principal funds by limiting default risk , market risk and reinvestment risk . we mitigate default risk by investing in investment grade securities . we have historically maintained a relatively short average maturity for our investment portfolio , and we believe a hypothetical 100 basis point adverse move in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would not materially affect the fair value of our interest sensitive financial instruments . foreign currency exchange risk although most of our revenue is realized in u.s . dollars , some portions of our revenue are realized in foreign currencies . as a result , our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets . the functional currencies of our subsidiaries are their respective local currencies . accordingly , the accounts of these operations are translated from the local currency to the u.s . dollar using the current exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date for the balance sheet accounts , and using the average exchange rate during the period for revenue and expense accounts . the effects of translation are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income as a separate component of stockholders 2019 equity. .

pension expense decreased from the prior year due to lower pension settlements , lower loss amortization , primarily from favorable asset experience and the impact of higher discount rates , partially offset by lower expected returns on assets . special items ( settlements , termination benefits , and curtailments ) decreased from the prior year primarily due to lower pension settlement losses . in fiscal year 2019 , special items of $ 7.2 included pension settlement losses of $ 6.4 , of which $ 5.0 was recorded during the second quarter and related to the u.s . supplementary pension plan , and $ .8 of termination benefits . these amounts are reflected within ""other non- operating income ( expense ) , net"" on the consolidated income statements . in fiscal year 2018 , special items of $ 48.9 included a pension settlement loss of $ 43.7 primarily in connection with the transfer of certain pension assets and payment obligations for our u.s . salaried and hourly plans to an insurer during the fourth quarter , $ 4.8 of pension settlement losses related to lump sum payouts from the u.s . supplementary pension plan , and $ .4 of termination benefits . u.k . lloyds equalization ruling on 26 october 2018 , the united kingdom high court issued a ruling related to the equalization of pension plan participants 2019 benefits for the gender effects of guaranteed minimum pensions . as a result of this ruling , we estimated the impact of retroactively increasing benefits in our u.k . plan in accordance with the high court ruling . we treated the additional benefits as a prior service cost , which resulted in an increase to our projected benefit obligation and accumulated other comprehensive loss of $ 4.7 during the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 . we are amortizing this cost over the average remaining life expectancy of the u.k . participants . 2020 outlook in fiscal year 2020 , we expect pension expense to be approximately $ 5 to $ 20 , which includes expected pension settlement losses of $ 5 to $ 10 , depending on the timing of retirements . the expected range reflects lower expected interest cost and higher total assets , partially offset by higher expected loss amortization primarily due to the impact of lower discount rates . in fiscal year 2020 , we expect pension expense to include approximately $ 105 for amortization of actuarial losses . in fiscal year 2019 , pension expense included amortization of actuarial losses of $ 76.2 . net actuarial losses of $ 424.4 were recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income in fiscal year 2019 . actuarial ( gains ) losses are amortized into pension expense over prospective periods to the extent they are not offset by future gains or losses . future changes in the discount rate and actual returns on plan assets different from expected returns would impact the actuarial ( gains ) losses and resulting amortization in years beyond fiscal year 2020 . pension funding pension funding includes both contributions to funded plans and benefit payments for unfunded plans , which are primarily non-qualified plans . with respect to funded plans , our funding policy is that contributions , combined with appreciation and earnings , will be sufficient to pay benefits without creating unnecessary surpluses . in addition , we make contributions to satisfy all legal funding requirements while managing our capacity to benefit from tax deductions attributable to plan contributions . with the assistance of third-party actuaries , we analyze the liabilities and demographics of each plan , which help guide the level of contributions . during 2019 and 2018 , our cash contributions to funded plans and benefit payments for unfunded plans were $ 40.2 and $ 68.3 , respectively . for fiscal year 2020 , cash contributions to defined benefit plans are estimated to be $ 30 to $ 40 . the estimate is based on expected contributions to certain international plans and anticipated benefit payments for unfunded plans , which are dependent upon the timing of retirements . actual future contributions will depend on future funding legislation , discount rates , investment performance , plan design , and various other factors . refer to the contractual obligations discussion on page 37 for a projection of future contributions. .

2012 compared to 2011 aeronautics 2019 net sales for 2012 increased $ 591 million , or 4% ( 4 % ) , compared to 2011 . the increase was attributable to higher net sales of approximately $ 745 million from f-35 lrip contracts principally due to increased production volume ; about $ 285 million from f-16 programs primarily due to higher aircraft deliveries ( 37 f-16 aircraft delivered in 2012 compared to 22 in 2011 ) partially offset by lower volume on sustainment activities due to the completion of modification programs for certain international customers ; and approximately $ 140 million from c-5 programs due to higher aircraft deliveries ( four c-5m aircraft delivered in 2012 compared to two in 2011 ) . partially offsetting the increases were lower net sales of approximately $ 365 million from decreased production volume and lower risk retirements on the f-22 program as final aircraft deliveries were completed in the second quarter of 2012 ; approximately $ 110 million from the f-35 development contract primarily due to the inception-to-date effect of reducing the profit booking rate in the second quarter of 2012 and to a lesser extent lower volume ; and about $ 95 million from a decrease in volume on other sustainment activities partially offset by various other aeronautics programs due to higher volume . net sales for c-130 programs were comparable to 2011 as a decline in sustainment activities largely was offset by increased aircraft deliveries . aeronautics 2019 operating profit for 2012 increased $ 69 million , or 4% ( 4 % ) , compared to 2011 . the increase was attributable to higher operating profit of approximately $ 105 million from c-130 programs due to an increase in risk retirements ; about $ 50 million from f-16 programs due to higher aircraft deliveries partially offset by a decline in risk retirements ; approximately $ 50 million from f-35 lrip contracts due to increased production volume and risk retirements ; and about $ 50 million from the completion of purchased intangible asset amortization on certain f-16 contracts . partially offsetting the increases was lower operating profit of about $ 90 million from the f-35 development contract primarily due to the inception- to-date effect of reducing the profit booking rate in the second quarter of 2012 ; approximately $ 50 million from decreased production volume and risk retirements on the f-22 program partially offset by a resolution of a contractual matter in the second quarter of 2012 ; and approximately $ 45 million primarily due to a decrease in risk retirements on other sustainment activities partially offset by various other aeronautics programs due to increased risk retirements and volume . operating profit for c-5 programs was comparable to 2011 . adjustments not related to volume , including net profit booking rate adjustments and other matters described above , were approximately $ 30 million lower for 2012 compared to 2011 . 2011 compared to 2010 aeronautics 2019 net sales for 2011 increased $ 1.3 billion , or 10% ( 10 % ) , compared to 2010 . the growth in net sales primarily was due to higher volume of about $ 850 million for work performed on the f-35 lrip contracts as production increased ; higher volume of about $ 745 million for c-130 programs due to an increase in deliveries ( 33 c-130j aircraft delivered in 2011 compared to 25 during 2010 ) and support activities ; about $ 425 million for f-16 support activities and an increase in aircraft deliveries ( 22 f-16 aircraft delivered in 2011 compared to 20 during 2010 ) ; and approximately $ 90 million for higher volume on c-5 programs ( two c-5m aircraft delivered in 2011 compared to one during 2010 ) . these increases partially were offset by a decline in net sales of approximately $ 675 million due to lower volume on the f-22 program and lower net sales of about $ 155 million for the f-35 development contract as development work decreased. .

the company and certain of its subsidiaries are currently under examination by the relevant taxing authorities for various tax years . the company regularly assesses the potential outcome of these examinations in each of the taxing jurisdictions when determining the adequacy of the amount of unrecognized tax benefit recorded . while it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular uncertain tax position , we believe we have appropriately accrued for our uncertain tax benefits . however , audit outcomes and the timing of audit settlements and future events that would impact our previously recorded unrecognized tax benefits and the range of anticipated increases or decreases in unrecognized tax benefits are subject to significant uncertainty . it is possible that the ultimate outcome of current or future examinations may exceed our provision for current unrecognized tax benefits in amounts that could be material , but cannot be estimated as of december 31 , 2017 . our effective tax rate and net income in any given future period could therefore be materially impacted . 21 . discontinued operations due to a portfolio evaluation in the first half of 2016 , management decided to pursue a strategic shift of its distribution companies in brazil , sul and eletropaulo , to reduce the company's exposure to the brazilian distribution market . eletropaulo 2014 in november 2017 , eletropaulo converted its preferred shares into ordinary shares and transitioned the listing of those shares into the novo mercado , which is a listing segment of the brazilian stock exchange with the highest standards of corporate governance . upon conversion of the preferred shares into ordinary shares , aes no longer controlled eletropaulo , but maintained significant influence over the business . as a result , the company deconsolidated eletropaulo . after deconsolidation , the company's 17% ( 17 % ) ownership interest is reflected as an equity method investment . the company recorded an after-tax loss on deconsolidation of $ 611 million , which primarily consisted of $ 455 million related to cumulative translation losses and $ 243 million related to pension losses reclassified from aocl . in december 2017 , all the remaining criteria were met for eletropaulo to qualify as a discontinued operation . therefore , its results of operations and financial position were reported as such in the consolidated financial statements for all periods presented . eletropaulo's pre-tax loss attributable to aes , including the loss on deconsolidation , for the years ended december 31 , 2017 and 2016 was $ 633 million and $ 192 million , respectively . eletropaulo's pre-tax income attributable to aes for the year ended december 31 , 2015 was $ 73 million . prior to its classification as discontinued operations , eletropaulo was reported in the brazil sbu reportable segment . sul 2014 the company executed an agreement for the sale of sul , a wholly-owned subsidiary , in june 2016 . the results of operations and financial position of sul are reported as discontinued operations in the consolidated financial statements for all periods presented . upon meeting the held-for-sale criteria , the company recognized an after-tax loss of $ 382 million comprised of a pre-tax impairment charge of $ 783 million , offset by a tax benefit of $ 266 million related to the impairment of the sul long lived assets and a tax benefit of $ 135 million for deferred taxes related to the investment in sul . prior to the impairment charge , the carrying value of the sul asset group of $ 1.6 billion was greater than its approximate fair value less costs to sell . however , the impairment charge was limited to the carrying value of the long lived assets of the sul disposal group . on october 31 , 2016 , the company completed the sale of sul and received final proceeds less costs to sell of $ 484 million , excluding contingent consideration . upon disposal of sul , the company incurred an additional after-tax .

although average short-duration advances for the year ended december 31 , 2013 increased compared to the year ended december 31 , 2012 , such average advances remained low relative to historical levels , mainly the result of clients continuing to hold higher levels of liquidity . average other interest-earning assets increased to $ 11.16 billion for the year ended december 31 , 2013 from $ 7.38 billion for the year ended december 31 , 2012 . the increased levels were primarily the result of higher levels of cash collateral provided in connection with our participation in principal securities finance transactions . aggregate average interest-bearing deposits increased to $ 109.25 billion for the year ended december 31 , 2013 from $ 98.39 billion for the year ended december 31 , 2012 . this increase was mainly due to higher levels of non-u.s . transaction accounts associated with the growth of new and existing business in assets under custody and administration . future transaction account levels will be influenced by the underlying asset servicing business , as well as market conditions , including the general levels of u.s . and non-u.s . interest rates . average other short-term borrowings declined to $ 3.79 billion for the year ended december 31 , 2013 from $ 4.68 billion for the year ended december 31 , 2012 , as higher levels of client deposits provided additional liquidity . average long-term debt increased to $ 8.42 billion for the year ended december 31 , 2013 from $ 7.01 billion for the year ended december 31 , 2012 . the increase primarily reflected the issuance of $ 1.0 billion of extendible notes by state street bank in december 2012 , the issuance of $ 1.5 billion of senior and subordinated debt in may 2013 , and the issuance of $ 1.0 billion of senior debt in november 2013 . this increase was partly offset by maturities of $ 1.75 billion of senior debt in the second quarter of 2012 . average other interest-bearing liabilities increased to $ 6.46 billion for the year ended december 31 , 2013 from $ 5.90 billion for the year ended december 31 , 2012 , primarily the result of higher levels of cash collateral received from clients in connection with our participation in principal securities finance transactions . several factors could affect future levels of our net interest revenue and margin , including the mix of client liabilities ; actions of various central banks ; changes in u.s . and non-u.s . interest rates ; changes in the various yield curves around the world ; revised or proposed regulatory capital or liquidity standards , or interpretations of those standards ; the amount of discount accretion generated by the former conduit securities that remain in our investment securities portfolio ; and the yields earned on securities purchased compared to the yields earned on securities sold or matured . based on market conditions and other factors , we continue to reinvest the majority of the proceeds from pay- downs and maturities of investment securities in highly-rated securities , such as u.s . treasury and agency securities , federal agency mortgage-backed securities and u.s . and non-u.s . mortgage- and asset-backed securities . the pace at which we continue to reinvest and the types of investment securities purchased will depend on the impact of market conditions and other factors over time . we expect these factors and the levels of global interest rates to dictate what effect our reinvestment program will have on future levels of our net interest revenue and net interest margin. .

( a ) includes collateral related to derivative instruments where an appropriate legal opinion has not been either sought or obtained . derivative receivables reported on the consolidated balance sheets were $ 64.1 billion and $ 59.7 billion at december 31 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively . these amounts represent the fair value of the derivative contracts after giving effect to legally enforceable master netting agreements and cash collateral held by the firm . however , in management 2019s view , the appropriate measure of current credit risk should also take into consideration additional liquid securities ( primarily u.s . government and agency securities and other group of seven nations ( 201cg7 201d ) government bonds ) and other cash collateral held by the firm aggregating $ 22.7 billion and $ 16.6 billion at december 31 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively , that may be used as security when the fair value of the client 2019s exposure is in the firm 2019s favor . the change in derivative receivables was predominantly related to client-driven market-making activities in cib . the increase in derivative receivables reflected the impact of market movements , which increased foreign exchange receivables , partially offset by reduced commodity derivative receivables . in addition to the collateral described in the preceding paragraph , the firm also holds additional collateral ( primarily cash , g7 government securities , other liquid government-agency and guaranteed securities , and corporate debt and equity securities ) delivered by clients at the initiation of transactions , as well as collateral related to contracts that have a non-daily call frequency and collateral that the firm has agreed to return but has not yet settled as of the reporting date . although this collateral does not reduce the balances and is not included in the table above , it is available as security against potential exposure that could arise should the fair value of the client 2019s derivative transactions move in the firm 2019s favor . the derivative receivables fair value , net of all collateral , also does not include other credit enhancements , such as letters of credit . for additional information on the firm 2019s use of collateral agreements , see note 6 . while useful as a current view of credit exposure , the net fair value of the derivative receivables does not capture the potential future variability of that credit exposure . to capture the potential future variability of credit exposure , the firm calculates , on a client-by-client basis , three measures of potential derivatives-related credit loss : peak , derivative risk equivalent ( 201cdre 201d ) , and average exposure ( 201cavg 201d ) . these measures all incorporate netting and collateral benefits , where applicable . peak represents a conservative measure of potential exposure to a counterparty calculated in a manner that is broadly equivalent to a 97.5% ( 97.5 % ) confidence level over the life of the transaction . peak is the primary measure used by the firm for setting of credit limits for derivative transactions , senior management reporting and derivatives exposure management . dre exposure is a measure that expresses the risk of derivative exposure on a basis intended to be equivalent to the risk of loan exposures . dre is a less extreme measure of potential credit loss than peak and is used for aggregating derivative credit risk exposures with loans and other credit risk . finally , avg is a measure of the expected fair value of the firm 2019s derivative receivables at future time periods , including the benefit of collateral . avg exposure over the total life of the derivative contract is used as the primary metric for pricing purposes and is used to calculate credit capital and the cva , as further described below . the three year avg exposure was $ 31.1 billion and $ 32.4 billion at december 31 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively , compared with derivative receivables , net of all collateral , of $ 41.4 billion and $ 43.1 billion at december 31 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively . the fair value of the firm 2019s derivative receivables incorporates an adjustment , the cva , to reflect the credit quality of counterparties . the cva is based on the firm 2019s avg to a counterparty and the counterparty 2019s credit spread in the credit derivatives market . the primary components of changes in cva are credit spreads , new deal activity or unwinds , and changes in the underlying market environment . the firm believes that active risk management is essential to controlling the dynamic credit .

|general & administrative|1.1% ( 1.1 % )|1.1% ( 1.1 % )|1.1% ( 1.1 % )|
although research & engineering decreased as a percentage of revenue in 2011 as compared to 2010 and in 2010 compared to 2009 , it has increased in absolute dollars by $ 154 million and $ 117 million , respectively . these increases in absolute dollars were driven in large part by the impact of the smith acquisition . income taxes the schlumberger effective tax rate was 24.4% ( 24.4 % ) in 2011 , 17.3% ( 17.3 % ) in 2010 , and 19.6% ( 19.6 % ) in 2009 . the schlumberger effective tax rate is sensitive to the geographic mix of earnings . when the percentage of pretax earnings generated outside of north america increases , the schlumberger effective tax rate will generally decrease . conversely , when the percentage of pretax earnings generated outside of north america decreases , the schlumberger effective tax rate will generally increase . the effective tax rate for both 2011 and 2010 was impacted by the charges and credits described in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements . excluding the impact of these charges and credits , the effective tax rate in 2011 was 24.0% ( 24.0 % ) compared to 20.6% ( 20.6 % ) in 2010 . this increase in the effective tax rate , excluding the impact of the charges and credits , was primarily attributable to the fact that schlumberger generated a larger proportion of its pretax earnings in north america in 2011 as compared to 2010 as a result of improved market conditions and the effect of a full year 2019s activity from the acquired smith businesses . the effective tax rate for 2009 was also impacted by the charges and credits described in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements , but to a much lesser extent . excluding charges and credits , the effective tax rate in 2010 was 20.6% ( 20.6 % ) compared to 19.2% ( 19.2 % ) in 2009 . this increase is largely attributable to the geographic mix of earnings as well as the inclusion of four months 2019 results from the acquisition of smith , which served to increase the schlumberger effective tax charges and credits schlumberger recorded significant charges and credits in continuing operations during 2011 , 2010 and 2009 . these charges and credits , which are summarized below , are more fully described in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements. .

as of december 31 , 2010 , the liability for uncertain income tax positions was $ 2.7 million . due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding timing of potential future cash flows associated with these liabilities , we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period in which these liabilities might be paid . we utilize blanket purchase orders to communicate expected annual requirements to many of our suppliers . requirements under blanket purchase orders generally do not become committed until several weeks prior to the company 2019s scheduled unit production . the purchase obligation amount presented above represents the value of commitments considered firm . results of operations our sales from continuing operations in 2010 were $ 1489.3 million surpassing 2009 sales of $ 1375.0 million by 8.3 percent . the increase in sales was due mostly to significantly higher sales in our water heater operations in china resulting from geographic expansion , market share gains and new product introductions as well as additional sales from our water treatment business acquired in november , 2009 . our sales from continuing operations were $ 1451.3 million in 2008 . the $ 76.3 million decline in sales from 2008 to 2009 was due to lower residential and commercial volume in north america , reflecting softness in the domestic housing market and a slowdown in the commercial water heater business and was partially offset by strong growth in water heater sales in china and improved year over year pricing . on december 13 , 2010 we entered into a definitive agreement to sell our electrical products company to regal beloit corporation for $ 700 million in cash and approximately 2.83 million shares of regal beloit common stock . the transaction , which has been approved by both companies' board of directors , is expected to close in the first half of 2011 . due to the pending sale , our electrical products segment has been accorded discontinued operations treatment in the accompanying financial statements . sales in 2010 , including sales of $ 701.8 million for our electrical products segment , were $ 2191.1 million . our gross profit margin for continuing operations in 2010 was 29.9 percent , compared with 28.7 percent in 2009 and 25.8 percent in 2008 . the improvement in margin from 2009 to 2010 was due to increased volume , cost containment activities and lower warranty costs which more than offset certain inefficiencies resulting from the may flood in our ashland city , tn water heater manufacturing facility . the increase in profit margin from 2008 to 2009 resulted from increased higher margin china water heater volume , aggressive cost reduction programs and lower material costs . selling , general and administrative expense ( sg&a ) was $ 36.9 million higher in 2010 than in 2009 . the increased sg&a , the majority of which was incurred in our china water heater operation , was associated with selling costs to support higher volume and new product lines . additional sg&a associated with our 2009 water treatment acquisition also contributed to the increase . sg&a was $ 8.5 million higher in 2009 than 2008 resulting mostly from an $ 8.2 million increase in our china water heater operation in support of higher volumes. .

Context: notes to consolidated financial statements jpmorgan chase & co . 150 jpmorgan chase & co . / 2007 annual report expected loss modeling in 2006 , the firm restructured four multi-seller conduits that it administers . the restructurings included enhancing the firm 2019s expected loss model . in determining the primary beneficiary of the conduits it administers , the firm uses a monte carlo 2013based model to estimate the expected losses of each of the conduits and considers the rela- tive rights and obligations of each of the variable interest holders . the variability to be considered in the modeling of expected losses is based on the design of the entity . the firm 2019s traditional multi-seller conduits are designed to pass credit risk , not liquidity risk , to its vari- able interest holders , as the assets are intended to be held in the conduit for the longer term . under fin 46r , the firm is required to run the monte carlo-based expected loss model each time a reconsideration event occurs . in applying this guidance to the conduits , the following events are considered to be reconsideration events as they could affect the determination of the primary beneficiary of the conduits : 2022 new deals , including the issuance of new or additional variable interests ( credit support , liquidity facilities , etc ) ; 2022 changes in usage , including the change in the level of outstand- ing variable interests ( credit support , liquidity facilities , etc ) ; 2022 modifications of asset purchase agreements ; and 2022 sales of interests held by the primary beneficiary . from an operational perspective , the firm does not run its monte carlo-based expected loss model every time there is a reconsidera- tion event due to the frequency of their occurrence . instead , the firm runs its expected loss model each quarter and includes a growth assumption for each conduit to ensure that a sufficient amount of elns exists for each conduit at any point during the quarter . as part of its normal quarterly model review , the firm reassesses the underlying assumptions and inputs of the expected loss model . during the second half of 2007 , certain assumptions used in the model were adjusted to reflect the then current market conditions . specifically , risk ratings and loss given default assumptions relating to residential subprime mortgage exposures were modified . for other nonmortgage-related asset classes , the firm determined that the assumptions in the model required little adjustment . as a result of the updates to the model , during the fourth quarter of 2007 the terms of the elns were renegotiated to increase the level of commit- ment and funded amounts to be provided by the eln holders . the total amount of expected loss notes outstanding at december 31 , 2007 and 2006 , were $ 130 million and $ 54 million , respectively . management concluded that the model assumptions used were reflective of market participant 2019s assumptions and appropriately considered the probability of a recurrence of recent market events . qualitative considerations the multi-seller conduits are primarily designed to provide an efficient means for clients to access the commercial paper market . the firm believes the conduits effectively disperse risk among all parties and that the preponderance of economic risk in the firm 2019s multi-seller conduits is not held by jpmorgan chase . the percentage of assets in the multi-seller conduits that the firm views as client-related represent 99% ( 99 % ) and 98% ( 98 % ) of the total conduits 2019 holdings at december 31 , 2007 and 2006 , respectively . consolidated sensitivity analysis on capital it is possible that the firm could be required to consolidate a vie if it were determined that the firm became the primary beneficiary of the vie under the provisions of fin 46r . the factors involved in making the determination of whether or not a vie should be consolidated are dis- cussed above and in note 1 on page 108 of this annual report . the table below shows the impact on the firm 2019s reported assets , liabilities , net income , tier 1 capital ratio and tier 1 leverage ratio if the firm were required to consolidate all of the multi-seller conduits that it administers . as of or for the year ending december 31 , 2007 .

the firm could fund purchases of assets from vies should it become necessary . investor intermediation as a financial intermediary , the firm creates certain types of vies and also structures transactions , typically derivative structures , with these vies to meet investor needs . the firm may also provide liquidity and other support . the risks inherent in the derivative instruments or liq- uidity commitments are managed similarly to other credit , market or liquidity risks to which the firm is exposed . the principal types of vies for which the firm is engaged in these structuring activities are municipal bond vehicles , credit-linked note vehicles and collateralized debt obligation vehicles . municipal bond vehicles the firm has created a series of secondary market trusts that provide short-term investors with qualifying tax-exempt investments , and that allow investors in tax-exempt securities to finance their investments at short-term tax-exempt rates . in a typical transaction , the vehicle pur- chases fixed-rate longer-term highly rated municipal bonds and funds the purchase by issuing two types of securities : ( 1 ) putable floating- rate certificates and ( 2 ) inverse floating-rate residual interests ( 201cresid- ual interests 201d ) . the maturity of each of the putable floating-rate certifi- cates and the residual interests is equal to the life of the vehicle , while the maturity of the underlying municipal bonds is longer . holders of the putable floating-rate certificates may 201cput 201d , or tender , the certifi- cates if the remarketing agent cannot successfully remarket the float- ing-rate certificates to another investor . a liquidity facility conditionally obligates the liquidity provider to fund the purchase of the tendered floating-rate certificates . upon termination of the vehicle , if the pro- ceeds from the sale of the underlying municipal bonds are not suffi- cient to repay the liquidity facility , the liquidity provider has recourse either to excess collateralization in the vehicle or the residual interest holders for reimbursement . the third-party holders of the residual interests in these vehicles could experience losses if the face amount of the putable floating-rate cer- tificates exceeds the market value of the municipal bonds upon termi- nation of the vehicle . certain vehicles require a smaller initial invest- ment by the residual interest holders and thus do not result in excess collateralization . for these vehicles there exists a reimbursement obli- .

Context: long-term product offerings include active and index strategies . our active strategies seek to earn attractive returns in excess of a market benchmark or performance hurdle while maintaining an appropriate risk profile . we offer two types of active strategies : those that rely primarily on fundamental research and those that utilize primarily quantitative models to drive portfolio construction . in contrast , index strategies seek to closely track the returns of a corresponding index , generally by investing in substantially the same underlying securities within the index or in a subset of those securities selected to approximate a similar risk and return profile of the index . index strategies include both our non-etf index products and ishares etfs . althoughmany clients use both active and index strategies , the application of these strategies may differ . for example , clients may use index products to gain exposure to a market or asset class . in addition , institutional non-etf index assignments tend to be very large ( multi-billion dollars ) and typically reflect low fee rates . this has the potential to exaggerate the significance of net flows in institutional index products on blackrock 2019s revenues and earnings . equity year-end 2015 equity aum totaled $ 2.424 trillion , reflecting net inflows of $ 52.8 billion . net inflows included $ 78.4 billion and $ 4.2 billion into ishares and active products , respectively . ishares net inflows were driven by the core series and flows into broad developed market equity exposures , and active net inflows reflected demand for international equities . ishares and active net inflows were partially offset by non-etf index net outflows of $ 29.8 billion . blackrock 2019s effective fee rates fluctuate due to changes in aummix . approximately half of blackrock 2019s equity aum is tied to international markets , including emerging markets , which tend to have higher fee rates than u.s . equity strategies . accordingly , fluctuations in international equity markets , which do not consistently move in tandemwith u.s . markets , may have a greater impact on blackrock 2019s effective equity fee rates and revenues . fixed income fixed income aum ended 2015 at $ 1.422 trillion , increasing $ 28.7 billion , or 2% ( 2 % ) , from december 31 , 2014 . the increase in aum reflected $ 76.9 billion in net inflows , partially offset by $ 48.2 billion in net market depreciation and foreign exchange movements . in 2015 , active net inflows of $ 35.9 billion were diversified across fixed income offerings , with strong flows into our unconstrained , total return and high yield strategies . flagship funds in these product areas include our unconstrained strategic income opportunities and fixed income strategies funds , with net inflows of $ 7.0 billion and $ 3.7 billion , respectively ; our total return fund with net inflows of $ 2.7 billion ; and our high yield bond fund with net inflows of $ 3.5 billion . fixed income ishares net inflows of $ 50.3 billion were led by flows into core , corporate and high yield bond funds . active and ishares net inflows were partially offset by non-etf index net outflows of $ 9.3 billion . multi-asset class blackrock 2019s multi-asset class teammanages a variety of balanced funds and bespoke mandates for a diversified client base that leverages our broad investment expertise in global equities , bonds , currencies and commodities , and our extensive risk management capabilities . investment solutions might include a combination of long-only portfolios and alternative investments as well as tactical asset allocation overlays . component changes in multi-asset class aum for 2015 are presented below .

( 1 ) amounts represent $ 366 million of aum acquired in the futureadvisor acquisition in october 2015 . the futureadvisor acquisition amount does not include aum that was held in ishares holdings . multi-asset class net inflows reflected ongoing institutional demand for our solutions-based advice with $ 17.4 billion of net inflows coming from institutional clients . defined contribution plans of institutional clients remained a significant driver of flows , and contributed $ 7.3 billion to institutional multi-asset class net new business in 2015 , primarily into target date and target risk product offerings . retail net outflows of $ 1.3 billion were primarily due to a large single-client transition out of mutual funds into a series of ishares across asset classes . notwithstanding this transition , retail flows reflected demand for our multi-asset income fund family , which raised $ 4.6 billion in 2015 . the company 2019s multi-asset class strategies include the following : 2022 asset allocation and balanced products represented 49% ( 49 % ) of multi-asset class aum at year-end , with growth in aum driven by net new business of $ 12.9 billion . these strategies combine equity , fixed income and alternative components for investors seeking a tailored solution relative to a specific benchmark and within a risk budget . in certain cases , these strategies seek to minimize downside risk through diversification , derivatives strategies and tactical asset allocation decisions . flagship products in this category include our global allocation andmulti-asset income suites. .

Context: royal caribbean cruises ltd . 79 notes to the consolidated financial statements in 2012 , we determined the implied fair value of good- will for the pullmantur reporting unit was $ 145.5 mil- lion and recognized an impairment charge of $ 319.2 million based on a probability-weighted discounted cash flow model further discussed below . this impair- ment charge was recognized in earnings during the fourth quarter of 2012 and is reported within impair- ment of pullmantur related assets within our consoli- dated statements of comprehensive income ( loss ) . during the fourth quarter of 2014 , we performed a qualitative assessment of whether it was more-likely- than-not that our royal caribbean international reporting unit 2019s fair value was less than its carrying amount before applying the two-step goodwill impair- ment test . the qualitative analysis included assessing the impact of certain factors such as general economic conditions , limitations on accessing capital , changes in forecasted operating results , changes in fuel prices and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates . based on our qualitative assessment , we concluded that it was more-likely-than-not that the estimated fair value of the royal caribbean international reporting unit exceeded its carrying value and thus , we did not pro- ceed to the two-step goodwill impairment test . no indicators of impairment exist primarily because the reporting unit 2019s fair value has consistently exceeded its carrying value by a significant margin , its financial performance has been solid in the face of mixed economic environments and forecasts of operating results generated by the reporting unit appear suffi- cient to support its carrying value . we also performed our annual impairment review of goodwill for pullmantur 2019s reporting unit during the fourth quarter of 2014 . we did not perform a quali- tative assessment but instead proceeded directly to the two-step goodwill impairment test . we estimated the fair value of the pullmantur reporting unit using a probability-weighted discounted cash flow model . the principal assumptions used in the discounted cash flow model are projected operating results , weighted- average cost of capital , and terminal value . signifi- cantly impacting these assumptions are the transfer of vessels from our other cruise brands to pullmantur . the discounted cash flow model used our 2015 pro- jected operating results as a base . to that base , we added future years 2019 cash flows assuming multiple rev- enue and expense scenarios that reflect the impact of different global economic environments beyond 2015 on pullmantur 2019s reporting unit . we assigned a probability to each revenue and expense scenario . we discounted the projected cash flows using rates specific to pullmantur 2019s reporting unit based on its weighted-average cost of capital . based on the probability-weighted discounted cash flows , we deter- mined the fair value of the pullmantur reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by approximately 52% ( 52 % ) resulting in no impairment to pullmantur 2019s goodwill . pullmantur is a brand targeted primarily at the spanish , portuguese and latin american markets , with an increasing focus on latin america . the persistent economic instability in these markets has created sig- nificant uncertainties in forecasting operating results and future cash flows used in our impairment analyses . we continue to monitor economic events in these markets for their potential impact on pullmantur 2019s business and valuation . further , the estimation of fair value utilizing discounted expected future cash flows includes numerous uncertainties which require our significant judgment when making assumptions of expected revenues , operating costs , marketing , sell- ing and administrative expenses , interest rates , ship additions and retirements as well as assumptions regarding the cruise vacation industry 2019s competitive environment and general economic and business conditions , among other factors . if there are changes to the projected future cash flows used in the impairment analyses , especially in net yields or if certain transfers of vessels from our other cruise brands to the pullmantur fleet do not take place , it is possible that an impairment charge of pullmantur 2019s reporting unit 2019s goodwill may be required . of these factors , the planned transfers of vessels to the pullmantur fleet is most significant to the projected future cash flows . if the transfers do not occur , we will likely fail step one of the impairment test . note 4 . intangible assets intangible assets are reported in other assets in our consolidated balance sheets and consist of the follow- ing ( in thousands ) : .

Context: citigroup 2019s repurchases are primarily from government sponsored entities . the specific representations and warranties made by the company depend on the nature of the transaction and the requirements of the buyer . market conditions and credit-ratings agency requirements may also affect representations and warranties and the other provisions the company may agree to in loan sales . in the event of a breach of the representations and warranties , the company may be required to either repurchase the mortgage loans ( generally at unpaid principal balance plus accrued interest ) with the identified defects or indemnify ( 201cmake-whole 201d ) the investor or insurer . the company has recorded a repurchase reserve that is included in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet . in the case of a repurchase , the company will bear any subsequent credit loss on the mortgage loans . the company 2019s representations and warranties are generally not subject to stated limits in amount or time of coverage . however , contractual liability arises only when the representations and warranties are breached and generally only when a loss results from the breach . in the case of a repurchase , the loan is typically considered a credit- impaired loan and accounted for under sop 03-3 , 201caccounting for certain loans and debt securities , acquired in a transfer 201d ( now incorporated into asc 310-30 , receivables 2014loans and debt securities acquired with deteriorated credit quality ) . these repurchases have not had a material impact on nonperforming loan statistics , because credit-impaired purchased sop 03-3 loans are not included in nonaccrual loans . the company estimates its exposure to losses from its obligation to repurchase previously sold loans based on the probability of repurchase or make-whole and an estimated loss given repurchase or make-whole . this estimate is calculated separately by sales vintage ( i.e. , the year the loans were sold ) based on a combination of historical trends and forecasted repurchases and losses considering the : ( 1 ) trends in requests by investors for loan documentation packages to be reviewed ; ( 2 ) trends in recent repurchases and make-wholes ; ( 3 ) historical percentage of claims made as a percentage of loan documentation package requests ; ( 4 ) success rate in appealing claims ; ( 5 ) inventory of unresolved claims ; and ( 6 ) estimated loss given repurchase or make-whole , including the loss of principal , accrued interest , and foreclosure costs . the company does not change its estimation methodology by counterparty , but the historical experience and trends are considered when evaluating the overall reserve . the request for loan documentation packages is an early indicator of a potential claim . during 2009 , loan documentation package requests and the level of outstanding claims increased . in addition , our loss severity estimates increased during 2009 due to the impact of macroeconomic factors and recent experience . these factors contributed to a $ 493 million change in estimate for this reserve in 2009 . as indicated above , the repurchase reserve is calculated by sales vintage . the majority of the repurchases in 2009 were from the 2006 and 2007 sales vintages , which also represent the vintages with the largest loss- given-repurchase . an insignificant percentage of 2009 repurchases were from vintages prior to 2006 , and this is expected to decrease , because those vintages are later in the credit cycle . although early in the credit cycle , the company has experienced improved repurchase and loss-given-repurchase statistics from the 2008 and 2009 vintages . in the case of a repurchase of a credit-impaired sop 03-3 loan ( now incorporated into asc 310-30 ) , the difference between the loan 2019s fair value and unpaid principal balance at the time of the repurchase is recorded as a utilization of the repurchase reserve . payments to make the investor whole are also treated as utilizations and charged directly against the reserve . the provision for estimated probable losses arising from loan sales is recorded as an adjustment to the gain on sale , which is included in other revenue in the consolidated statement of income . a liability for representations and warranties is estimated when the company sells loans and is updated quarterly . any subsequent adjustment to the provision is recorded in other revenue in the consolidated statement of income . the activity in the repurchase reserve for the years ended december 31 , 2009 and 2008 is as follows: .

Context: 2022 international . in general , our international markets are less advanced with respect to the current technologies deployed for wireless services . as a result , demand for our communications sites is driven by continued voice network investments , new market entrants and initial 3g data network deployments . for example , in india , nationwide voice networks continue to be deployed as wireless service providers are beginning their initial investments in 3g data networks , as a result of recent spectrum auctions . in mexico and brazil , where nationwide voice networks have been deployed , some incumbent wireless service providers continue to invest in their 3g data networks , and recent spectrum auctions have enabled other incumbent wireless service providers and new market entrants to begin their initial investments in 3g data networks . in markets such as chile and peru , recent spectrum auctions have attracted new market entrants , who are expected to begin their investment in deploying nationwide voice and 3g data networks . we believe demand for our tower sites will continue in our international markets as wireless service providers seek to remain competitive by increasing the coverage of their networks while also investing in next generation data networks . rental and management operations new site revenue growth . during the year ended december 31 , 2010 , we grew our portfolio of communications sites through acquisitions and construction activities , including the acquisition and construction of approximately 7800 sites . we continue to evaluate opportunities to acquire larger communications site portfolios , both domestically and internationally , that we believe we can effectively integrate into our existing portfolio. .

Context: entergy mississippi , inc . management's financial discussion and analysis the net wholesale revenue variance is primarily due to lower profit on joint account sales and reduced capacity revenue from the municipal energy agency of mississippi . gross operating revenues , fuel and purchased power expenses , and other regulatory charges gross operating revenues increased primarily due to an increase of $ 152.5 million in fuel cost recovery revenues due to higher fuel rates , partially offset by a decrease of $ 43 million in gross wholesale revenues due to a decrease in net generation and purchases in excess of decreased net area demand resulting in less energy available for resale sales coupled with a decrease in system agreement remedy receipts . fuel and purchased power expenses increased primarily due to increases in the average market prices of natural gas and purchased power , partially offset by decreased demand and decreased recovery from customers of deferred fuel costs . other regulatory charges increased primarily due to increased recovery through the grand gulf rider of grand gulf capacity costs due to higher rates and increased recovery of costs associated with the power management recovery rider . there is no material effect on net income due to quarterly adjustments to the power management recovery rider . 2007 compared to 2006 net revenue consists of operating revenues net of : 1 ) fuel , fuel-related expenses , and gas purchased for resale , 2 ) purchased power expenses , and 3 ) other regulatory charges ( credits ) . following is an analysis of the change in net revenue comparing 2007 to 2006 . amount ( in millions ) .

|2007 net revenue|$ 486.9|
the base revenue variance is primarily due to a formula rate plan increase effective july 2007 . the formula rate plan filing is discussed further in ""state and local rate regulation"" below . the volume/weather variance is primarily due to increased electricity usage primarily in the residential and commercial sectors , including the effect of more favorable weather on billed electric sales in 2007 compared to 2006 . billed electricity usage increased 214 gwh . the increase in usage was partially offset by decreased usage in the industrial sector . the transmission revenue variance is due to higher rates and the addition of new transmission customers in late 2006 . the transmission equalization variance is primarily due to a revision made in 2006 of transmission equalization receipts among entergy companies . the reserve equalization variance is primarily due to a revision in 2006 of reserve equalization payments among entergy companies due to a ferc ruling regarding the inclusion of interruptible loads in reserve .

Context: entergy new orleans , inc . management 2019s financial discussion and analysis the volume/weather variance is primarily due to an increase in electricity usage in the residential and commercial sectors due in part to a 4% ( 4 % ) increase in the average number of residential customers and a 3% ( 3 % ) increase in the average number of commercial customers , partially offset by the effect of less favorable weather on residential sales . gross operating revenues gross operating revenues decreased primarily due to : a decrease of $ 16.2 million in electric fuel cost recovery revenues due to lower fuel rates ; a decrease of $ 15.4 million in gross gas revenues primarily due to lower fuel cost recovery revenues as a result of lower fuel rates and the effect of milder weather ; and formula rate plan decreases effective october 2010 and october 2011 , as discussed above . the decrease was partially offset by an increase in gross wholesale revenue due to increased sales to affiliated customers and more favorable volume/weather , as discussed above . 2010 compared to 2009 net revenue consists of operating revenues net of : 1 ) fuel , fuel-related expenses , and gas purchased for resale , 2 ) purchased power expenses , and 3 ) other regulatory charges ( credits ) . following is an analysis of the change in net revenue comparing 2010 to 2009 . amount ( in millions ) .

Context: management 2019s discussion and analysis 2011 versus 2010 . net revenues in investing & lending were $ 2.14 billion and $ 7.54 billion for 2011 and 2010 , respectively . during 2011 , investing & lending results reflected an operating environment characterized by a significant decline in equity markets in europe and asia , and unfavorable credit markets that were negatively impacted by increased concerns regarding the weakened state of global economies , including heightened european sovereign debt risk . results for 2011 included a loss of $ 517 million from our investment in the ordinary shares of icbc and net gains of $ 1.12 billion from other investments in equities , primarily in private equities , partially offset by losses from public equities . in addition , investing & lending included net revenues of $ 96 million from debt securities and loans . this amount includes approximately $ 1 billion of unrealized losses related to relationship lending activities , including the effect of hedges , offset by net interest income and net gains from other debt securities and loans . results for 2011 also included other net revenues of $ 1.44 billion , principally related to our consolidated investment entities . results for 2010 included a gain of $ 747 million from our investment in the ordinary shares of icbc , a net gain of $ 2.69 billion from other investments in equities , a net gain of $ 2.60 billion from debt securities and loans and other net revenues of $ 1.51 billion , principally related to our consolidated investment entities . the net gain from other investments in equities was primarily driven by an increase in global equity markets , which resulted in appreciation of both our public and private equity positions and provided favorable conditions for initial public offerings . the net gains and net interest from debt securities and loans primarily reflected the impact of tighter credit spreads and favorable credit markets during the year , which provided favorable conditions for borrowers to refinance . operating expenses were $ 2.67 billion for 2011 , 20% ( 20 % ) lower than 2010 , due to decreased compensation and benefits expenses , primarily resulting from lower net revenues . this decrease was partially offset by the impact of impairment charges related to consolidated investments during 2011 . pre-tax loss was $ 531 million in 2011 , compared with pre-tax earnings of $ 4.18 billion in 2010 . investment management investment management provides investment management services and offers investment products ( primarily through separately managed accounts and commingled vehicles , such as mutual funds and private investment funds ) across all major asset classes to a diverse set of institutional and individual clients . investment management also offers wealth advisory services , including portfolio management and financial counseling , and brokerage and other transaction services to high-net-worth individuals and families . assets under supervision include assets under management and other client assets . assets under management include client assets where we earn a fee for managing assets on a discretionary basis . this includes net assets in our mutual funds , hedge funds , credit funds and private equity funds ( including real estate funds ) , and separately managed accounts for institutional and individual investors . other client assets include client assets invested with third-party managers , private bank deposits and assets related to advisory relationships where we earn a fee for advisory and other services , but do not have discretion over the assets . assets under supervision do not include the self-directed brokerage accounts of our clients . assets under management and other client assets typically generate fees as a percentage of net asset value , which vary by asset class and are affected by investment performance as well as asset inflows and redemptions . in certain circumstances , we are also entitled to receive incentive fees based on a percentage of a fund 2019s return or when the return exceeds a specified benchmark or other performance targets . incentive fees are recognized only when all material contingencies are resolved . the table below presents the operating results of our investment management segment. .

|interest expense|$ 137.0|$ 130.5|
interest incurred increased $ .5 as interest expense associated with financing the lu'an joint venture was mostly offset by favorable impacts from currency , a lower average interest rate on the debt portfolio , and a lower average debt balance . capitalized interest decreased 31% ( 31 % ) , or $ 6.0 , due to a decrease in the carrying value of projects under construction , primarily driven by the lu'an project in asia . other non-operating income ( expense ) , net other non-operating income ( expense ) , net of $ 66.7 increased $ 61.6 , primarily due to lower pension settlement losses , higher non-service pension income , and higher interest income on cash and cash items . the prior year included pension settlement losses of $ 43.7 ( $ 33.2 after-tax , or $ .15 per share ) primarily in connection with the transfer of certain pension assets and payment obligations to an insurer for our u.s . salaried and hourly plans . in fiscal year 2019 , we recognized a pension settlement loss of $ 5.0 ( $ 3.8 after-tax , or $ .02 per share ) associated with the u.s . supplementary pension plan during the second quarter . net income and net income margin net income of $ 1809.4 increased 18% ( 18 % ) , or $ 276.5 , primarily due to impacts from the u.s . tax cuts and jobs act , positive pricing , and favorable volumes . net income margin of 20.3% ( 20.3 % ) increased 310 bp . adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin adjusted ebitda of $ 3468.0 increased 11% ( 11 % ) , or $ 352.5 , primarily due to positive pricing and higher volumes , partially offset by unfavorable currency . adjusted ebitda margin of 38.9% ( 38.9 % ) increased 400 bp , primarily due to higher volumes , positive pricing , and the india contract modification . the india contract modification contributed 80 bp . effective tax rate the effective tax rate equals the income tax provision divided by income from continuing operations before taxes . the effective tax rate was 21.0% ( 21.0 % ) and 26.0% ( 26.0 % ) in fiscal years 2019 and 2018 , respectively . the current year rate was lower primarily due to impacts related to the enactment of the u.s . tax cuts and jobs act ( the 201ctax act"" ) in 2018 , which significantly changed existing u.s . tax laws , including a reduction in the federal corporate income tax rate from 35% ( 35 % ) to 21% ( 21 % ) , a deemed repatriation tax on unremitted foreign earnings , as well as other changes . as a result of the tax act , our income tax provision reflects discrete net income tax costs of $ 43.8 and $ 180.6 in fiscal years 2019 and 2018 , respectively . the current year included a cost of $ 56.2 ( $ .26 per share ) for the reversal of a benefit recorded in 2018 related to the u.s . taxation of deemed foreign dividends . we recorded this reversal based on regulations issued in 2019 . the 2019 reversal was partially offset by a favorable adjustment of $ 12.4 ( $ .06 per share ) that was recorded as we completed our estimates of the impacts of the tax act . this adjustment is primarily related to foreign tax items , including the deemed repatriation tax for foreign tax redeterminations . in addition , the current year rate included a net gain on the exchange of two equity affiliates of $ 29.1 , which was not a taxable transaction . the higher 2018 expense resulting from the tax act was partially offset by a $ 35.7 tax benefit from the restructuring of foreign subsidiaries , a $ 9.1 benefit from a foreign audit settlement agreement , and higher excess tax benefits on share-based compensation . the adjusted effective tax rate was 19.4% ( 19.4 % ) and 18.6% ( 18.6 % ) in fiscal years 2019 and 2018 , respectively . the lower prior year rate was primarily due to the $ 9.1 benefit from a foreign audit settlement agreement and higher excess tax benefits on share-based compensation. .

the risk-free interest rate is based on the yield of a zero coupon united states treasury security with a maturity equal to the expected life of the option from the date of the grant . our assumption on expected volatility is based on our historical volatility . the dividend yield assumption is calculated using our average stock price over the preceding year and the annualized amount of our current quarterly dividend . since the purchase price for shares under the plan is based on the market value on the first day or last day of the quarterly purchase period , we use an expected life of three months to determine the fair value of each designated share. .

Context: notes to the consolidated financial statements competitive environment and general economic and business conditions , among other factors . pullmantur is a brand targeted primarily at the spanish , portu- guese and latin american markets and although pullmantur has diversified its passenger sourcing over the past few years , spain still represents pullmantur 2019s largest market . as previously disclosed , during 2012 european economies continued to demonstrate insta- bility in light of heightened concerns over sovereign debt issues as well as the impact of proposed auster- ity measures on certain markets . the spanish econ- omy was more severely impacted than many other economies and there is significant uncertainty as to when it will recover . in addition , the impact of the costa concordia incident has had a more lingering effect than expected and the impact in future years is uncertain . these factors were identified in the past as significant risks which could lead to the impairment of pullmantur 2019s goodwill . more recently , the spanish economy has progressively worsened and forecasts suggest the challenging operating environment will continue for an extended period of time . the unemployment rate in spain reached 26% ( 26 % ) during the fourth quarter of 2012 and is expected to rise further in 2013 . the international monetary fund , which had projected gdp growth of 1.8% ( 1.8 % ) a year ago , revised its 2013 gdp projections downward for spain to a contraction of 1.3% ( 1.3 % ) during the fourth quarter of 2012 and further reduced it to a contraction of 1.5% ( 1.5 % ) in january of 2013 . during the latter half of 2012 new austerity measures , such as increases to the value added tax , cuts to benefits , the phasing out of exemptions and the suspension of government bonuses , were implemented by the spanish government . we believe these austerity measures are having a larger impact on consumer confidence and discretionary spending than previously anticipated . as a result , there has been a significant deterioration in bookings from guests sourced from spain during the 2013 wave season . the combination of all of these factors has caused us to negatively adjust our cash flow projections , especially our closer-in net yield assumptions and the expectations regarding future capacity growth for the brand . based on our updated cash flow projections , we determined the implied fair value of goodwill for the pullmantur reporting unit was $ 145.5 million and rec- ognized an impairment charge of $ 319.2 million . this impairment charge was recognized in earnings during the fourth quarter of 2012 and is reported within impairment of pullmantur related assets within our consolidated statements of comprehensive income ( loss ) . there have been no goodwill impairment charges related to the pullmantur reporting unit in prior periods . see note 13 . fair value measurements and derivative instruments for further discussion . if the spanish economy weakens further or recovers more slowly than contemplated or if the economies of other markets ( e.g . france , brazil , latin america ) perform worse than contemplated in our discounted cash flow model , or if there are material changes to the projected future cash flows used in the impair- ment analyses , especially in net yields , an additional impairment charge of the pullmantur reporting unit 2019s goodwill may be required . note 4 . intangible assets intangible assets are reported in other assets in our consolidated balance sheets and consist of the follow- ing ( in thousands ) : .

year-over-year change 22.4 % (  % ) 87.5 % (  % ) year-over-year changes in cash flow ( as defined ) were driven by improved performance in working capital resulting from the benefit derived from the pringles acquisition , as well as changes in the level of capital expenditures during the three-year period . investing activities our net cash used in investing activities for 2012 amounted to $ 3245 million , an increase of $ 2658 million compared with 2011 primarily attributable to the $ 2668 acquisition of pringles in capital spending in 2012 included investments in our supply chain infrastructure , and to support capacity requirements in certain markets , including pringles . in addition , we continued the investment in our information technology infrastructure related to the reimplementation and upgrade of our sap platform . net cash used in investing activities of $ 587 million in 2011 increased by $ 122 million compared with 2010 , reflecting capital projects for our

of ten-year 2.75% ( 2.75 % ) u.s . dollar notes . the proceeds from these notes will be used for general corporate purposes , including , together with cash on hand , repayment of the $ 750 million aggregate principal amount of our 4.25% ( 4.25 % ) u.s . dollar notes due march 2013 . the floating-rate notes bear interest equal to three-month libor plus 23 basis points , subject to quarterly reset . the notes contain customary covenants that limit the ability of kellogg company and its restricted subsidiaries ( as defined ) to incur certain liens or enter into certain sale and lease-back transactions , as well as a change of control provision . our net cash provided by financing activities was $ 1317 for 2012 , compared to net cash used in financing activities of $ 957 and $ 439 for 2011 and 2010 , respectively . the increase in cash provided from financing activities in 2012 compared to 2011 and 2010 , was primarily due to the issuance of debt related to the acquisition of pringles . total debt was $ 7.9 billion at year-end 2012 and $ 6.0 billion at year-end 2011 . in march 2012 , we entered into interest rate swaps on our $ 500 million five-year 1.875% ( 1.875 % ) fixed rate u.s . dollar notes due 2016 , $ 500 million ten-year 4.15% ( 4.15 % ) fixed rate u.s . dollar notes due 2019 and $ 500 million of our $ 750 million seven-year 4.45% ( 4.45 % ) fixed rate

proceeds of $ 498 million for general corporate purposes and repayment of commercial paper . during 2012 , we entered into interest rate swaps which effectively converted these notes from a fixed rate to a floating rate obligation through maturity . in april 2010 , our board of directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing us to repurchase shares of our common stock amounting to $ 2.5 billion during 2010 through 2012 . this three year authorization replaced previous share buyback programs which had authorized stock repurchases of up to $ 1.1 billion for 2010 and $ 650 million for 2009 . under this program , we repurchased approximately 1 million , 15 million and 21 million shares of common stock for $ 63 million , $ 793 million and $ 1.1 billion during 2012 , 2011 and 2010 ,

quarterly dividends to shareholders totaling $ 1.74 per share in 2012 , $ 1.67 per share in 2011 and $ 1.56 per share in 2010 . total cash paid for dividends increased by 3.0% ( 3.0 % ) in 2012 and 3.4% ( 3.4 % ) in 2011 . in march 2011 , we entered into an unsecured four- year credit agreement which allows us to borrow , on a revolving credit basis , up to $ 2.0 billion . our long-term debt agreements contain customary covenants that limit kellogg company and some of its subsidiaries from incurring certain liens or from entering into certain sale and lease-back transactions . some agreements also contain change in control provisions . however , they do not contain acceleration of maturity clauses that are dependent on credit ratings . a change in our credit ratings could limit our access to the u.s . short-term debt market and/or increase the cost of refinancing long-term debt in the future . however , even under these circumstances , we would continue to have access to our four-year credit agreement , which expires in march 2015 . this source of liquidity is unused and available on an unsecured basis , although we do not currently plan to use it . capital and credit markets , including commercial paper markets , continued to experience instability and disruption as the u.s . and global economies underwent a period of extreme uncertainty . throughout this period of uncertainty , we continued to have access to the u.s. , european , and canadian commercial paper markets . our commercial paper and term debt credit ratings were not affected by the changes in the credit environment . we monitor the financial strength of our third-party financial institutions , including those that hold our cash and cash equivalents as well as those who serve as counterparties to our credit facilities , our derivative financial instruments , and other arrangements . we are in compliance with all covenants as of december 29 , 2012 . we continue to believe that we will be able to meet our interest and principal repayment obligations and maintain our debt covenants for the foreseeable future , while still meeting our operational needs , including the pursuit of selected bolt-on acquisitions . this will be accomplished through our strong cash flow , our short- term borrowings , and our maintenance of credit facilities on a global basis. .

the perryville plant coming online in july 2005 ; n an increase of $ 12 million related to storm reserves . this increase does not include costs associated with hurricanes katrina and rita ; and n an increase of $ 12 million due to a return to normal expense patterns in 2006 versus the deferral or capitalization of storm costs in 2005 . other operation and maintenance expenses increased for non- utility nuclear from $ 588 million in 2005 to $ 637 million in 2006 primarily due to the timing of refueling outages , increased benefit and insurance costs , and increased nrc fees . taxes other than income taxes taxes other than income taxes increased for the utility from $ 322 million in 2005 to $ 361 million in 2006 primarily due to an increase in city franchise taxes in arkansas due to a change in 2006 in the accounting for city franchise tax revenues as directed by the apsc . the change results in an increase in taxes other than income taxes with a corresponding increase in rider revenue , resulting in no effect on net income . also contributing to the increase was higher franchise tax expense at entergy gulf states , inc . as a result of higher gross revenues in 2006 and a customer refund in 2005 . other income other income increased for the utility from $ 111 million in 2005 to $ 156 million in 2006 primarily due to carrying charges recorded on storm restoration costs . other income increased for non-utility nuclear primarily due to miscellaneous income of $ 27 million ( $ 16.6 million net-of-tax ) resulting from a reduction in the decommissioning liability for a plant as a result of a revised decommissioning cost study and changes in assumptions regarding the timing of when decommissioning of a plant will begin . other income increased for parent & other primarily due to a gain related to its entergy-koch investment of approximately $ 55 million ( net-of-tax ) in the fourth quarter of 2006 . in 2004 , entergy-koch sold its energy trading and pipeline businesses to third parties . at that time , entergy received $ 862 million of the sales proceeds in the form of a cash distribution by entergy-koch . due to the november 2006 expiration of

partnership will be less than $ 35 million . interest charges interest charges increased for the utility and parent & other primarily due to additional borrowing to fund the significant storm restoration costs associated with hurricanes katrina and rita . discontinued operations in april 2006 , entergy sold the retail electric portion of the competitive retail services business operating

of may 31 , 2014 the average duration of our short-term investments and cash equivalents portfolio was 126 days . to date we have not experienced difficulty accessing the credit markets or incurred higher interest costs . future volatility in the capital markets , however , may increase costs associated with issuing commercial paper or other debt instruments or affect our ability to access those markets . we believe that existing cash , cash equivalents , short-term investments , and cash generated by operations , together with access to external sources of funds as described above , will be sufficient to meet our domestic and foreign capital needs in the foreseeable future . we utilize a variety of tax planning and financing strategies to manage our worldwide cash and deploy funds to locations where they are needed . we routinely repatriate a portion of our foreign earnings for which u.s . taxes have previously been provided . we also indefinitely reinvest a significant portion of our foreign earnings , and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate these earnings . should we require additional capital in the united states , we may elect to repatriate indefinitely reinvested foreign funds or raise capital in the united states through debt . if we were to repatriate indefinitely reinvested foreign funds , we would be required to accrue and pay additional u.s . taxes less applicable foreign tax credits . if we elect to raise capital in the united states through debt , we would incur additional interest expense . off-balance sheet arrangements in connection with various contracts and agreements , we routinely provide indemnification relating to the enforceability of intellectual property rights , coverage for legal issues that arise and other items where we are acting as the guarantor . currently , we have several such agreements in place . however , based on our historical experience and the estimated probability of future loss , we have determined that the fair value of such indemnification is not material to our financial position or results of operations . contractual obligations our significant long-term contractual obligations as of may 31 , 2014 and significant endorsement contracts entered into through the date of this report are as follows: .

oil sands mining segment we hold a 20 percent non-operated interest in the aosp , an oil sands mining and upgrading joint venture located in alberta , canada . the joint venture produces bitumen from oil sands deposits in the athabasca region utilizing mining techniques and upgrades the bitumen to synthetic crude oils and vacuum gas oil . the aosp 2019s mining and extraction assets are located near fort mcmurray , alberta , and include the muskeg river and the jackpine mines . gross design capacity of the combined mines is 255000 ( 51000 net to our interest ) barrels of bitumen per day . the aosp operations use established processes to mine oil sands deposits from an open-pit mine , extract the bitumen and upgrade it into synthetic crude oils . ore is mined using traditional truck and shovel mining techniques . the mined ore passes through primary crushers to reduce the ore chunks in size and is then sent to rotary breakers where the ore chunks are further reduced to smaller particles . the particles are combined with hot water to create slurry . the slurry moves through the extraction process where it separates into sand , clay and bitumen-rich froth . a solvent is added to the bitumen froth to separate out the remaining solids , water and heavy asphaltenes . the solvent washes the sand and produces clean bitumen that is required for the upgrader to run efficiently . the process yields a mixture of solvent and bitumen which is then transported from the mine to the scotford upgrader via the approximately 300-mile corridor pipeline . the aosp's scotford upgrader is located at fort saskatchewan , northeast of edmonton , alberta . the bitumen is upgraded at scotford using both hydrotreating and hydroconversion processes to remove sulfur and break the heavy bitumen molecules into lighter products . blendstocks acquired from outside sources are utilized in the production of our saleable products . the upgrader produces synthetic crude oils and vacuum gas oil . the vacuum gas oil is sold to an affiliate of the operator under a long-term contract at market-related prices , and the other products are sold in the marketplace . as of december 31 , 2014 , we own or have rights to participate in developed and undeveloped leases totaling approximately 163000 gross ( 33000 net ) acres . the underlying developed leases are held for the duration of the project , with royalties payable to the province of alberta . synthetic crude oil sales volumes for 2014 averaged 50 mbbld and net-of-royalty production was 41 mbbld . in december 2013 , a jackpine mine expansion project received conditional approval from the canadian government . the project includes additional mining areas , associated processing facilities and infrastructure . the government conditions relate to wildlife , the environment and aboriginal health issues . we will evaluate the potential expansion project and government conditions after infrastructure reliability initiatives are completed . the governments of alberta and canada have agreed to partially fund quest ccs for $ 865 million canadian . in the third quarter of 2012 , the energy and resources conservation board ( ""ercb"" ) , alberta's primary energy regulator at that time , conditionally approved the project and the aosp partners approved proceeding to construct and operate quest ccs . government funding commenced in 2012 and continued as milestones were achieved during the development , construction and operating phases . failure of the aosp to meet certain timing , performance and operating objectives may result in repaying some of the government funding . construction and commissioning of quest ccs is expected to be completed by late 2015. .

Context: management 2019s discussion and analysis 126 jpmorgan chase & co./2014 annual report while useful as a current view of credit exposure , the net fair value of the derivative receivables does not capture the potential future variability of that credit exposure . to capture the potential future variability of credit exposure , the firm calculates , on a client-by-client basis , three measures of potential derivatives-related credit loss : peak , derivative risk equivalent ( 201cdre 201d ) , and average exposure ( 201cavg 201d ) . these measures all incorporate netting and collateral benefits , where applicable . peak exposure to a counterparty is an extreme measure of exposure calculated at a 97.5% ( 97.5 % ) confidence level . dre exposure is a measure that expresses the risk of derivative exposure on a basis intended to be equivalent to the risk of loan exposures . the measurement is done by equating the unexpected loss in a derivative counterparty exposure ( which takes into consideration both the loss volatility and the credit rating of the counterparty ) with the unexpected loss in a loan exposure ( which takes into consideration only the credit rating of the counterparty ) . dre is a less extreme measure of potential credit loss than peak and is the primary measure used by the firm for credit approval of derivative transactions . finally , avg is a measure of the expected fair value of the firm 2019s derivative receivables at future time periods , including the benefit of collateral . avg exposure over the total life of the derivative contract is used as the primary metric for pricing purposes and is used to calculate credit capital and the cva , as further described below . the three year avg exposure was $ 37.5 billion and $ 35.4 billion at december 31 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively , compared with derivative receivables , net of all collateral , of $ 59.4 billion and $ 51.3 billion at december 31 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively . the fair value of the firm 2019s derivative receivables incorporates an adjustment , the cva , to reflect the credit quality of counterparties . the cva is based on the firm 2019s avg to a counterparty and the counterparty 2019s credit spread in the credit derivatives market . the primary components of changes in cva are credit spreads , new deal activity or unwinds , and changes in the underlying market environment . the firm believes that active risk management is essential to controlling the dynamic credit risk in the derivatives portfolio . in addition , the firm 2019s risk management process takes into consideration the potential impact of wrong-way risk , which is broadly defined as the potential for increased correlation between the firm 2019s exposure to a counterparty ( avg ) and the counterparty 2019s credit quality . many factors may influence the nature and magnitude of these correlations over time . to the extent that these correlations are identified , the firm may adjust the cva associated with that counterparty 2019s avg . the firm risk manages exposure to changes in cva by entering into credit derivative transactions , as well as interest rate , foreign exchange , equity and commodity derivative transactions . the accompanying graph shows exposure profiles to the firm 2019s current derivatives portfolio over the next 10 years as calculated by the dre and avg metrics . the two measures generally show that exposure will decline after the first year , if no new trades are added to the portfolio . the following table summarizes the ratings profile by derivative counterparty of the firm 2019s derivative receivables , including credit derivatives , net of other liquid securities collateral , for the dates indicated . the ratings scale is based on the firm 2019s internal ratings , which generally correspond to the ratings as defined by s&p and moody 2019s . ratings profile of derivative receivables rating equivalent 2014 2013 ( a ) december 31 , ( in millions , except ratios ) exposure net of all collateral % (  % ) of exposure net of all collateral exposure net of all collateral % (  % ) of exposure net of all collateral .

commitments consist primarily of lease agreements for office space , automobiles , and office equipment that expire at various dates . unfunded commitments as of december 31 , 2016 , the company has outstanding commitments totaling $ 1.6 billion , of which $ 1.2 billion is committed to fund limited partnership and other alternative investments , which may be called by the partnership during the commitment period to fund the purchase of new investments and partnership expenses . additionally , $ 313 of the outstanding commitments relate to various funding obligations associated with private placement securities . the remaining outstanding commitments of $ 95 relate to mortgage loans the company is expecting to fund in the first half of 2017 . guaranty funds and other insurance-related assessments in all states , insurers licensed to transact certain classes of insurance are required to become members of a guaranty fund . in most states , in the event of the insolvency of an insurer writing any such class of insurance in the state , the guaranty funds may assess its members to pay covered claims of the insolvent insurers . assessments are based on each member 2019s proportionate share of written premiums in the state for the classes of insurance in which the insolvent insurer was engaged . assessments are generally limited for any year to one or two percent of the premiums written per year depending on the state . some states permit member insurers to recover assessments paid through surcharges on policyholders or through full or partial premium tax offsets , while other states permit recovery of assessments through the rate filing process . liabilities for guaranty fund and other insurance-related assessments are accrued when an assessment is probable , when it can be reasonably estimated , and when the event obligating the company to pay an imposed or probable assessment has occurred . liabilities for guaranty funds and other insurance- related assessments are not discounted and are included as part of other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets . as of december 31 , 2016 and 2015 the liability balance was $ 134 and $ 138 , respectively . as of december 31 , 2016 and 2015 amounts related to premium tax offsets of $ 34 and $ 44 , respectively , were included in other assets . derivative commitments certain of the company 2019s derivative agreements contain provisions that are tied to the financial strength ratings , as set by nationally recognized statistical agencies , of the individual legal entity that entered into the derivative agreement . if the legal entity 2019s financial strength were to fall below certain ratings , the counterparties to the derivative agreements could demand immediate and ongoing full collateralization and in certain instances enable the counterparties to terminate the agreements and demand immediate settlement of all outstanding derivative positions traded under each impacted bilateral agreement . the settlement amount is determined by netting the derivative positions transacted under each agreement . if the termination rights were to be exercised by the counterparties , it could impact the legal entity 2019s ability to conduct hedging activities by increasing the associated costs and decreasing the willingness of counterparties to transact with the legal entity . the aggregate fair value of all derivative instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features that are in a net liability position as of december 31 , 2016 was $ 1.4 billion . of this $ 1.4 billion , the legal entities have posted collateral of $ 1.7 billion in the normal course of business . in addition , the company has posted collateral of $ 31 associated with a customized gmwb derivative . based on derivative market values as of december 31 , 2016 , a downgrade of one level below the current financial strength ratings by either moody 2019s or s&p would not require additional assets to be posted as collateral . based on derivative market values as of december 31 , 2016 , a downgrade of two levels below the current financial strength ratings by either moody 2019s or s&p would require additional $ 10 of assets to be posted as collateral . these collateral amounts could change as derivative market values change , as a result of changes in our hedging activities or to the extent changes in contractual terms are negotiated . the nature of the collateral that we post , when required , is primarily in the form of u.s . treasury bills , u.s . treasury notes and government agency securities . guarantees in the ordinary course of selling businesses or entities to third parties , the company has agreed to indemnify purchasers for losses arising subsequent to the closing due to breaches of representations and warranties with respect to the business or entity being sold or with respect to covenants and obligations of the company and/or its subsidiaries . these obligations are typically subject to various time limitations , defined by the contract or by operation of law , such as statutes of limitation . in some cases , the maximum potential obligation is subject to contractual limitations , while in other cases such limitations are not specified or applicable . the company does not expect to make any payments on these guarantees and is not carrying any

Context: foreign currency exchange rate risk many of our non-u.s . companies maintain both assets and liabilities in local currencies . therefore , foreign exchange rate risk is generally limited to net assets denominated in those foreign currencies . foreign exchange rate risk is reviewed as part of our risk management process . locally required capital levels are invested in home currencies in order to satisfy regulatory require- ments and to support local insurance operations regardless of currency fluctuations . the principal currencies creating foreign exchange risk for us are the british pound sterling , the euro , and the canadian dollar . the following table provides more information on our exposure to foreign exchange rate risk at december 31 , 2008 and 2007. .

reinsurance of gmdb and gmib guarantees our net income is directly impacted by changes in the reserves calculated in connection with the reinsurance of variable annuity guarantees , primarily gmdb and gmib . these reserves are calculated in accordance with sop 03-1 ( sop reserves ) and changes in these reserves are reflected as life and annuity benefit expense , which is included in life underwriting income . in addition , our net income is directly impacted by the change in the fair value of the gmib liability ( fvl ) , which is classified as a derivative according to fas 133 . the fair value liability established for a gmib reinsurance contract represents the differ- ence between the fair value of the contract and the sop 03-1 reserves . changes in the fair value of the gmib liability , net of associated changes in the calculated sop 03-1 reserve , are reflected as realized gains or losses . ace views our variable annuity reinsurance business as having a similar risk profile to that of catastrophe reinsurance , with the probability of long-term economic loss relatively small at the time of pricing . adverse changes in market factors and policyholder behavior will have an impact on both life underwriting income and net income . when evaluating these risks , we expect to be compensated for taking both the risk of a cumulative long-term economic net loss , as well as the short-term accounting variations caused by these market movements . therefore , we evaluate this business in terms of its long-term eco- nomic risk and reward . the ultimate risk to the variable annuity guaranty reinsurance business is a long-term underperformance of investment returns , which can be exacerbated by a long-term reduction in interest rates . following a market downturn , continued market underperformance over a period of five to seven years would eventually result in a higher level of paid claims as policyholders accessed their guarantees through death or annuitization . however , if market conditions improved following a downturn , sop 03-1 reserves and fair value liability would fall reflecting a decreased likelihood of future claims , which would result in an increase in both life underwriting income and net income . as of december 31 , 2008 , management established the sop 03-1 reserve based on the benefit ratio calculated using actual market values at december 31 , 2008 . management exercises judgment in determining the extent to which short-term market movements impact the sop 03-1 reserve . the sop 03-1 reserve is based on the calculation of a long-term benefit ratio ( or loss ratio ) for the variable annuity guarantee reinsurance . despite the long-term nature of the risk the benefit ratio calculation is impacted by short-term market movements that may be judged by management to be temporary or transient . management will , in keeping with the language in sop 03-1 , regularly examine both quantitative and qualitative analysis and management will determine if , in its judgment , the change in the calculated benefit ratio is of sufficient magnitude and has persisted for a sufficient duration to warrant a change in the benefit ratio used to establish the sop 03-1 reserve . this has no impact on either premium received or claims paid nor does it impact the long-term profit or loss of the variable annuity guaran- tee reinsurance . the sop 03-1 reserve and fair value liability calculations are directly affected by market factors , including equity levels , interest rate levels , credit risk and implied volatilities , as well as policyholder behaviors , such as annuitization and lapse rates . the table below shows the sensitivity , as of december 31 , 2008 , of the sop 03-1 reserves and fair value liability associated with the variable annuity guarantee reinsurance portfolio . in addition , the tables below show the sensitivity of the fair value of specific derivative instruments held ( hedge value ) , which includes instruments purchased in january 2009 , to partially offset the risk in the variable annuity guarantee reinsurance portfolio . although these derivatives do not receive hedge accounting treatment , some portion of the change in value may be used to offset changes in the sop 03-1 reserve. .

Context: troubled debt restructurings ( tdrs ) a tdr is a loan whose terms have been restructured in a manner that grants a concession to a borrower experiencing financial difficulties . tdrs result from our loss mitigation activities , and include rate reductions , principal forgiveness , postponement/reduction of scheduled amortization , and extensions , which are intended to minimize economic loss and to avoid foreclosure or repossession of collateral . additionally , tdrs also result from borrowers that have been discharged from personal liability through chapter 7 bankruptcy and have not formally reaffirmed their loan obligations to pnc . in those situations where principal is forgiven , the amount of such principal forgiveness is immediately charged off . some tdrs may not ultimately result in the full collection of principal and interest , as restructured , and result in potential incremental losses . these potential incremental losses have been factored into our overall alll estimate . the level of any subsequent defaults will likely be affected by future economic conditions . once a loan becomes a tdr , it will continue to be reported as a tdr until it is ultimately repaid in full , the collateral is foreclosed upon , or it is fully charged off . we held specific reserves in the alll of $ .5 billion and $ .6 billion at december 31 , 2013 and december 31 , 2012 , respectively , for the total tdr portfolio . table 70 : summary of troubled debt restructurings in millions dec . 31 dec . 31 .

alternative for the soil remediation component of the overall site remedy . in october 2011 , the epa released a public statement indicating that the final soil remedy decision would be delayed . in the unlikely event that the epa changes its proposed soil remedy and approves instead a more expensive clean- up alternative , the remediation costs could be material , and significantly higher than amounts currently recorded . in october 2012 , the natural resource trustees for this site provided notice to international paper and other potentially responsible parties of their intent to perform a

Context: item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk stemming from changes in interest rates , foreign exchange rates , commodity prices and equity prices . changes in these factors could cause fluctuations in our earnings and cash flows . in the normal course of business , we actively manage our exposure to these market risks by entering into various hedging trans- actions , authorized under our policies that place clear controls on these activities . the counterparties in these transactions are generally highly rated institutions . we establish credit limits for each counterparty . our hedging transactions include but are not limited to a variety of deriv- ative financial instruments . interest rates we manage our debt structure and our interest rate risk through the use of fixed- and floating-rate debt and derivatives . we use interest rate swaps and forward-starting interest rate swaps to hedge our exposure to interest rate changes and to reduce volatility of our financing costs . generally under these swaps , we agree with a counterparty to exchange the difference between fixed- rate and floating-rate interest amounts based on an agreed notional principal amount . our primary exposure is to u.s . interest rates . as of may 28 , 2006 , we had $ 7.0 billion of aggregate notional principal amount ( the principal amount on which the fixed or floating interest rate is calculated ) outstanding . this includes notional amounts of offsetting swaps that neutralize our exposure to interest rates on other interest rate swaps . see note six to the consolidated finan- cial statements on pages 40 through 42 in item eight of this report . foreign currency rates foreign currency fluctuations can affect our net investments and earnings denominated in foreign currencies . we primarily use foreign currency forward contracts and option contracts to selectively hedge our cash flow exposure to changes in exchange rates . these contracts function as hedges , since they change in value inversely to the change created in the underlying exposure as foreign exchange rates fluctuate . our primary u.s . dollar exchange rate exposures are with the canadian dollar , the euro , the australian dollar , the mexican peso and the british pound . commodities many commodities we use in the produc- tion and distribution of our products are exposed to market price risks . we manage this market risk through an inte- grated set of financial instruments , including purchase orders , noncancelable contracts , futures contracts , options and swaps . our primary commodity price exposures are to cereal grains , sugar , dairy products , vegetables , fruits , meats , vegetable oils , and other agricultural products , as well as paper and plastic packaging materials , operating supplies and energy . equity instruments equity price movements affect our compensation expense as certain investments owned by our employees are revalued . we use equity swaps to manage this market risk . value at risk these estimates are intended to measure the maximum potential fair value we could lose in one day from adverse changes in market interest rates , foreign exchange rates , commodity prices , or equity prices under normal market conditions . a monte carlo ( var ) method- ology was used to quantify the market risk for our exposures . the models assumed normal market conditions and used a 95 percent confidence level . the var calculation used historical interest rates , foreign exchange rates and commodity and equity prices from the past year to estimate the potential volatility and correlation of these rates in the future . the market data were drawn from the riskmetricstm data set . the calculations are not intended to represent actual losses in fair value that we expect to incur . further , since the hedging instrument ( the derivative ) inversely correlates with the underlying expo- sure , we would expect that any loss or gain in the fair value of our derivatives would be generally offset by an increase or decrease in the fair value of the underlying exposures . the positions included in the calculations were : debt ; invest- ments ; interest rate swaps ; foreign exchange forwards ; commodity swaps , futures and options ; and equity instru- ments . the calculations do not include the underlying foreign exchange and commodities-related positions that are hedged by these market-risk-sensitive instruments . the table below presents the estimated maximum poten- tial one-day loss in fair value for our interest rate , foreign currency , commodity and equity market-risk-sensitive instruments outstanding on may 28 , 2006 and may 29 , 2005 , and the average amount outstanding during the year ended may 28 , 2006 . the amounts were calculated using the var methodology described above. .

the perryville plant coming online in july 2005 ; n an increase of $ 12 million related to storm reserves . this increase does not include costs associated with hurricanes katrina and rita ; and n an increase of $ 12 million due to a return to normal expense patterns in 2006 versus the deferral or capitalization of storm costs in 2005 . other operation and maintenance expenses increased for non- utility nuclear from $ 588 million in 2005 to $ 637 million in 2006 primarily due to the timing of refueling outages , increased benefit and insurance costs , and increased nrc fees . taxes other than income taxes taxes other than income taxes increased for the utility from $ 322 million in 2005 to $ 361 million in 2006 primarily due to an increase in city franchise taxes in arkansas due to a change in 2006 in the accounting for city franchise tax revenues as directed by the apsc . the change results in an increase in taxes other than income taxes with a corresponding increase in rider revenue , resulting in no effect on net income . also contributing to the increase was higher franchise tax expense at entergy gulf states , inc . as a result of higher gross revenues in 2006 and a customer refund in 2005 . other income other income increased for the utility from $ 111 million in 2005 to $ 156 million in 2006 primarily due to carrying charges recorded on storm restoration costs . other income increased for non-utility nuclear primarily due to miscellaneous income of $ 27 million ( $ 16.6 million net-of-tax ) resulting from a reduction in the decommissioning liability for a plant as a result of a revised decommissioning cost study and changes in assumptions regarding the timing of when decommissioning of a plant will begin . other income increased for parent & other primarily due to a gain related to its entergy-koch investment of approximately $ 55 million ( net-of-tax ) in the fourth quarter of 2006 . in 2004 , entergy-koch sold its energy trading and pipeline businesses to third parties . at that time , entergy received $ 862 million of the sales proceeds in the form of a cash distribution by entergy-koch . due to the november 2006 expiration of contingencies on the sale of entergy-koch 2019s trading business , and the corresponding release to entergy-koch of sales proceeds held in escrow , entergy received additional cash distributions of approximately $ 163 million during the fourth quarter of 2006 and recorded a gain of approximately $ 55 million ( net-of-tax ) . entergy expects future cash distributions upon liquidation of the partnership will be less than $ 35 million . interest charges interest charges increased for the utility and parent & other primarily due to additional borrowing to fund the significant storm restoration costs associated with hurricanes katrina and rita . discontinued operations in april 2006 , entergy sold the retail electric portion of the competitive retail services business operating in the electric reliability council of texas ( ercot ) region of texas , and now reports this portion of the business as a discontinued operation . earnings for 2005 were negatively affected by $ 44.8 million ( net-of-tax ) of discontinued operations due to the planned sale . this amount includes a net charge of $ 25.8 million ( net-of-tax ) related to the impairment reserve for the remaining net book value of the competitive retail services business 2019 information technology systems . results for 2006 include an $ 11.1 million gain ( net-of-tax ) on the sale of the retail electric portion of the competitive retail services business operating in the ercot region of texas . income taxes the effective income tax rates for 2006 and 2005 were 27.6% ( 27.6 % ) and 36.6% ( 36.6 % ) , respectively . the lower effective income tax rate in 2006 is primarily due to tax benefits , net of reserves , resulting from the tax capital loss recognized in connection with the liquidation of entergy power international holdings , entergy 2019s holding company for entergy-koch . also contributing to the lower rate for 2006 is an irs audit settlement that allowed entergy to release from its tax reserves all settled issues relating to 1996-1998 audit cycle . see note 3 to the financial statements for a reconciliation of the federal statutory rate of 35.0% ( 35.0 % ) to the effective income tax rates , and for additional discussion regarding income taxes . liquidity and capital resources this section discusses entergy 2019s capital structure , capital spending plans and other uses of capital , sources of capital , and the cash flow activity presented in the cash flow statement . capital structure entergy 2019s capitalization is balanced between equity and debt , as shown in the following table . the increase in the debt to capital percentage from 2006 to 2007 is primarily the result of additional borrowings under entergy corporation 2019s revolving credit facility , along with a decrease in shareholders 2019 equity primarily due to repurchases of common stock . this increase in the debt to capital percentage is in line with entergy 2019s financial and risk management aspirations . the decrease in the debt to capital percentage from 2005 to 2006 is the result of an increase in shareholders 2019 equity , primarily due to an increase in retained earnings , partially offset by repurchases of common stock. .

( 1 ) we reduced our total pool of overhead costs , through staff reductions and other measures , as the result of changes in our product mix and anticipated future levels of third-party construction , leasing , management and other operational activities . ( 2 ) we increased our focus on development of wholly-owned properties , and also significantly increased our leasing activity during 2012 , which resulted in an increased absorption of overhead costs . we capitalized $ 30.4 million and $ 20.0 million of our total overhead costs to leasing and development , respectively , for consolidated properties during 2012 , compared to capitalizing $ 25.3 million and $ 10.4 million of such costs , respectively , for 2011 . combined overhead costs capitalized to leasing and development totaled 31.1% ( 31.1 % ) and 20.6% ( 20.6 % ) of our overall pool of overhead costs for 2012 and 2011 , respectively . ( 3 ) the reduction in the allocation of overhead costs to service operations and rental operations resulted from reduced volumes of third-party construction projects as well as due to reducing our overall investment in office properties , which are more management intensive . interest expense interest expense allocable to continuing operations increased from $ 220.5 million in 2011 to $ 245.2 million in 2012 . we had $ 47.4 million of interest expense allocated to discontinued operations in 2011 , associated with the properties that were disposed of during 2011 , compared to the allocation of only $ 3.1 million of interest expense to discontinued operations for 2012 . total interest expense , combined for continuing and discontinued operations , decreased from $ 267.8 million in 2011 to $ 248.3 million in 2012 . the reduction in total interest expense was primarily the result of a lower weighted average borrowing rate in 2012 , due to refinancing some higher rate bonds in 2011 and 2012 , as well as a slight decrease in our average level of borrowings compared to 2011 . also , due to an increase in properties under development from 2011 , which met the criteria for capitalization of interest and were financed in part by common equity issuances during 2012 , a $ 5.0 million increase in capitalized interest also contributed to the decrease in total interest expense in 2012 . acquisition-related activity during 2012 , we recognized approximately $ 4.2 million in acquisition costs , compared to $ 2.3 million of such costs in 2011 . the increase from 2011 to 2012 is the result of acquiring a higher volume of medical office properties , where a higher level of acquisition costs are incurred than other property types , in 2012 . during 2011 , we also recognized a $ 1.1 million gain related to the acquisition of a building from one of our 50%-owned unconsolidated joint ventures . discontinued operations subject to certain criteria , the results of operations for properties sold during the year to unrelated parties , or classified as held-for-sale at the end of the period , are required to be classified as discontinued operations . the property specific components of earnings that are classified as discontinued operations include rental revenues , rental expenses , real estate taxes , allocated interest expense and depreciation expense , as well as the net gain or loss on the disposition of properties . the operations of 150 buildings are currently classified as discontinued operations . these 150 buildings consist of 114 office , 30 industrial , four retail , and two medical office properties . as a result , we classified operating losses , before gain on sales , of $ 1.5 million , $ 1.8 million and $ 7.1 million in discontinued operations for the years ended december 31 , 2012 , 2011 and 2010 , respectively . of these properties , 28 were sold during 2012 , 101 properties were sold during 2011 and 19 properties were sold during 2010 . the gains on disposal of these properties of $ 13.5 million , $ 100.9 million and $ 33.1 million for the years ended december 31 , 2012 , 2011 and .

Context: indemnification and repurchase claims are typically settled on an individual loan basis through make-whole payments or loan repurchases ; however , on occasion we may negotiate pooled settlements with investors . in connection with pooled settlements , we typically do not repurchase loans and the consummation of such transactions generally results in us no longer having indemnification and repurchase exposure with the investor in the transaction . for the first and second-lien mortgage balances of unresolved and settled claims contained in the tables below , a significant amount of these claims were associated with sold loans originated through correspondent lender and broker origination channels . in certain instances when indemnification or repurchase claims are settled for these types of sold loans , we have recourse back to the correspondent lenders , brokers and other third-parties ( e.g. , contract underwriting companies , closing agents , appraisers , etc. ) . depending on the underlying reason for the investor claim , we determine our ability to pursue recourse with these parties and file claims with them accordingly . our historical recourse recovery rate has been insignificant as our efforts have been impacted by the inability of such parties to reimburse us for their recourse obligations ( e.g. , their capital availability or whether they remain in business ) or factors that limit our ability to pursue recourse from these parties ( e.g. , contractual loss caps , statutes of limitations ) . origination and sale of residential mortgages is an ongoing business activity , and , accordingly , management continually assesses the need to recognize indemnification and repurchase liabilities pursuant to the associated investor sale agreements . we establish indemnification and repurchase liabilities for estimated losses on sold first and second-lien mortgages for which indemnification is expected to be provided or for loans that are expected to be repurchased . for the first and second- lien mortgage sold portfolio , we have established an indemnification and repurchase liability pursuant to investor sale agreements based on claims made , demand patterns observed to date and/or expected in the future , and our estimate of future claims on a loan by loan basis . to estimate the mortgage repurchase liability arising from breaches of representations and warranties , we consider the following factors : ( i ) borrower performance in our historically sold portfolio ( both actual and estimated future defaults ) , ( ii ) the level of outstanding unresolved repurchase claims , ( iii ) estimated probable future repurchase claims , considering information about file requests , delinquent and liquidated loans , resolved and unresolved mortgage insurance rescission notices and our historical experience with claim rescissions , ( iv ) the potential ability to cure the defects identified in the repurchase claims ( 201crescission rate 201d ) , and ( v ) the estimated severity of loss upon repurchase of the loan or collateral , make-whole settlement , or indemnification . see note 24 commitments and guarantees in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report for additional information . the following tables present the unpaid principal balance of repurchase claims by vintage and total unresolved repurchase claims for the past five quarters . table 28 : analysis of quarterly residential mortgage repurchase claims by vintage dollars in millions december 31 september 30 june 30 march 31 december 31 .

net sales for aeronautics increased by 8% ( 8 % ) in 2010 compared to 2009 . sales increased in all three lines of business during the year . the $ 800 million increase in air mobility primarily was attributable to higher volume on c-130 programs , including deliveries and support activities , as well as higher volume on the c-5 reliability enhancement and re-engining program ( rerp ) . there were 25 c-130j deliveries in 2010 compared to 16 in 2009 . the $ 179 million increase in combat aircraft principally was due to higher volume on f-35 production contracts , which partially was offset by lower volume on the f-35 sdd contract and a decline in volume on f-16 , f-22 and other combat aircraft programs . there were 20 f-16 deliveries in 2010 compared to 31 in 2009 . the $ 55 million increase in other aeronautics programs mainly was due to higher volume on p-3 and advanced development programs , which partially were offset by a decline in volume on sustainment activities . net sales for aeronautics increased by 6% ( 6 % ) in 2009 compared to 2008 . during the year , sales increased in all three lines of business . the increase of $ 296 million in air mobility 2019s sales primarily was attributable to higher volume on the c-130 programs , including deliveries and support activities . there were 16 c-130j deliveries in 2009 and 12 in 2008 . combat aircraft sales increased $ 316 million principally due to higher volume on the f-35 program and increases in f-16 deliveries , which partially were offset by lower volume on f-22 and other combat aircraft programs . there were 31 f-16 deliveries in 2009 compared to 28 in 2008 . the $ 116 million increase in other aeronautics programs mainly was due to higher volume on p-3 programs and advanced development programs , which partially were offset by declines in sustainment activities . operating profit for the segment decreased by 5% ( 5 % ) in 2010 compared to 2009 . a decline in operating profit in combat aircraft partially was offset by increases in other aeronautics programs and air mobility . the $ 149 million decrease in combat aircraft 2019s operating profit primarily was due to lower volume and a decrease in the level of favorable performance adjustments on the f-22 program , the f-35 sdd contract and f-16 and other combat aircraft programs in 2010 . these decreases more than offset increased operating profit resulting from higher volume and improved performance on f-35 production contracts in 2010 . the $ 35 million increase in other aeronautics programs mainly was attributable to higher volume and improved performance on p-3 and advanced development programs as well as an increase in the level of favorable performance adjustments on sustainment activities in 2010 . the $ 19 million increase in air mobility operating profit primarily was due to higher volume and improved performance in 2010 on c-130j support activities , which more than offset a decrease in operating profit due to a lower level of favorable performance adjustments on c-130j deliveries in 2010 . the remaining change in operating profit is attributable to an increase in other income , net between the comparable periods . aeronautics 2019 2010 operating margins have decreased when compared to 2009 . the operating margin decrease reflects the life cycles of our significant programs . specifically , aeronautics is performing more development and initial production work on the f-35 program and is performing less work on more mature programs such as the f-22 and f-16 . development and initial production contracts yield lower profits than mature full rate programs . accordingly , while net sales increased in 2010 relative to 2009 , operating profit decreased and consequently operating margins have declined. .

Context: long-term product offerings include active and index strategies . our active strategies seek to earn attractive returns in excess of a market benchmark or performance hurdle while maintaining an appropriate risk profile . we offer two types of active strategies : those that rely primarily on fundamental research and those that utilize primarily quantitative models to drive portfolio construction . in contrast , index strategies seek to closely track the returns of a corresponding index , generally by investing in substantially the same underlying securities within the index or in a subset of those securities selected to approximate a similar risk and return profile of the index . index strategies include both our non-etf index products and ishares etfs . althoughmany clients use both active and index strategies , the application of these strategies may differ . for example , clients may use index products to gain exposure to a market or asset class . in addition , institutional non-etf index assignments tend to be very large ( multi-billion dollars ) and typically reflect low fee rates . this has the potential to exaggerate the significance of net flows in institutional index products on blackrock 2019s revenues and earnings . equity year-end 2015 equity aum totaled $ 2.424 trillion , reflecting net inflows of $ 52.8 billion . net inflows included $ 78.4 billion and $ 4.2 billion into ishares and active products , respectively . ishares net inflows were driven by the core series and flows into broad developed market equity exposures , and active net inflows reflected demand for international equities . ishares and active net inflows were partially offset by non-etf index net outflows of $ 29.8 billion . blackrock 2019s effective fee rates fluctuate due to changes in aummix . approximately half of blackrock 2019s equity aum is tied to international markets , including emerging markets , which tend to have higher fee rates than u.s . equity strategies . accordingly , fluctuations in international equity markets , which do not consistently move in tandemwith u.s . markets , may have a greater impact on blackrock 2019s effective equity fee rates and revenues . fixed income fixed income aum ended 2015 at $ 1.422 trillion , increasing $ 28.7 billion , or 2% ( 2 % ) , from december 31 , 2014 . the increase in aum reflected $ 76.9 billion in net inflows , partially offset by $ 48.2 billion in net market depreciation and foreign exchange movements . in 2015 , active net inflows of $ 35.9 billion were diversified across fixed income offerings , with strong flows into our unconstrained , total return and high yield strategies . flagship funds in these product areas include our unconstrained strategic income opportunities and fixed income strategies funds , with net inflows of $ 7.0 billion and $ 3.7 billion , respectively ; our total return fund with net inflows of $ 2.7 billion ; and our high yield bond fund with net inflows of $ 3.5 billion . fixed income ishares net inflows of $ 50.3 billion were led by flows into core , corporate and high yield bond funds . active and ishares net inflows were partially offset by non-etf index net outflows of $ 9.3 billion . multi-asset class blackrock 2019s multi-asset class teammanages a variety of balanced funds and bespoke mandates for a diversified client base that leverages our broad investment expertise in global equities , bonds , currencies and commodities , and our extensive risk management capabilities . investment solutions might include a combination of long-only portfolios and alternative investments as well as tactical asset allocation overlays . component changes in multi-asset class aum for 2015 are presented below .

[1] the following points are significant to understanding the cash flows estimated for obligations under property and casualty contracts : reserves for property & casualty unpaid claim and claim adjustment expenses include case reserves for reported claims and reserves for claims incurred but not reported ( ibnr ) . while payments due on claim reserves are considered contractual obligations because they relate to insurance policies issued by the company , the ultimate amount to be paid to settle both case reserves and ibnr is an estimate , subject to significant uncertainty . the actual amount to be paid is not determined until the company reaches a settlement with the claimant . final claim settlements may vary significantly from the present estimates , particularly since many claims will not be settled until well into the future . in estimating the timing of future payments by year , the company has assumed that its historical payment patterns will continue . however , the actual timing of future payments will likely vary materially from these estimates due to , among other things , changes in claim reporting and payment patterns and large unanticipated settlements . in particular , there is significant uncertainty over the claim payment patterns of asbestos and environmental claims . also , estimated payments in 2005 do not include payments that will be made on claims incurred in 2005 on policies that were in force as of december 31 , 2004 . in addition , the table does not include future cash flows related to the receipt of premiums that will be used , in part , to fund loss payments . under generally accepted accounting principles , the company is only permitted to discount reserves for claim and claim adjustment expenses in cases where the payment pattern and ultimate loss costs are fixed and reliably determinable on an individual claim basis . for the company , these include claim settlements with permanently disabled claimants and certain structured settlement contracts that fund loss runoffs for unrelated parties . as of december 31 , 2004 , the total property and casualty reserves in the above table of $ 21885 are gross of the reserve discount of $ 556 . [2] estimated life , annuity and disability obligations include death and disability claims , policy surrenders , policyholder dividends and trail commissions offset by expected future deposits and premiums on in-force contracts . estimated contractual policyholder obligations are based on mortality , morbidity and lapse assumptions comparable with life 2019s historical experience , modified for recent observed trends . life has also assumed market growth and interest crediting consistent with assumptions used in amortizing deferred acquisition costs . in contrast to this table , the majority of life 2019s obligations are recorded on the balance sheet at the current account value , as described in critical accounting estimates , and do not incorporate an expectation of future market growth , interest crediting , or future deposits . therefore , the estimated contractual policyholder obligations presented in this table significantly exceed the liabilities recorded in reserve for future policy benefits and unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses , other policyholder funds and benefits payable and separate account liabilities . due to the significance of the assumptions used , the amounts presented could materially differ from actual results . as separate account obligations are legally insulated from general account obligations , the separate account obligations will be fully funded by cash flows from separate account assets . life expects to fully fund the general account obligations from cash flows from general account investments and future deposits and premiums . [3] includes contractual principal and interest payments . payments exclude amounts associated with fair-value hedges of certain of the company 2019s long-term debt . all long-term debt obligations have fixed rates of interest . long-term debt obligations also includes principal and interest payments of $ 700 and $ 2.4 billion , respectively , related to junior subordinated debentures which are callable beginning in 2006 . see note 14 of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of long-term debt obligations . [4] includes $ 1.4 billion in commitments to purchase investments including $ 330 of limited partnerships and $ 299 of mortgage loans . outstanding commitments under these limited partnerships and mortgage loans are included in payments due in less than 1 year since the timing of funding these commitments cannot be estimated . the remaining $ 759 relates to payables for securities purchased which are reflected on the company 2019s consolidated balance sheet . [5] includes estimated contribution of $ 200 to the company 2019s pension plan in 2005 . [6] as of december 31 , 2004 , the company has accepted cash collateral of $ 1.6 billion in connection with the company 2019s securities lending program and derivative instruments . since the timing of the return of the collateral is uncertain , the return of the collateral has been included in the payments due in less than 1 year .

Context: investment policy , which is described more fully in note 15 employee benefit plans in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report . we calculate the expense associated with the pension plan and the assumptions and methods that we use include a policy of reflecting trust assets at their fair market value . on an annual basis , we review the actuarial assumptions related to the pension plan , including the discount rate , the rate of compensation increase and the expected return on plan assets . the discount rate and compensation increase assumptions do not significantly affect pension expense . however , the expected long-term return on assets assumption does significantly affect pension expense . our expected long- term return on plan assets for determining net periodic pension expense has been 8.25% ( 8.25 % ) for the past three years . the expected return on plan assets is a long-term assumption established by considering historical and anticipated returns of the asset classes invested in by the pension plan and the allocation strategy currently in place among those classes . while this analysis gives appropriate consideration to recent asset performance and historical returns , the assumption represents a long-term prospective return . we review this assumption at each measurement date and adjust it if warranted . for purposes of setting and reviewing this assumption , 201clong- term 201d refers to the period over which the plan 2019s projected benefit obligation will be disbursed . while year-to-year annual returns can vary significantly ( rates of return for the reporting years of 2009 , 2008 , and 2007 were +20.61% ( +20.61 % ) , -32.91% ( -32.91 % ) , and +7.57% ( +7.57 % ) , respectively ) , the assumption represents our estimate of long-term average prospective returns . our selection process references certain historical data and the current environment , but primarily utilizes qualitative judgment regarding future return expectations . recent annual returns may differ but , recognizing the volatility and unpredictability of investment returns , we generally do not change the assumption unless we modify our investment strategy or identify events that would alter our expectations of future returns . to evaluate the continued reasonableness of our assumption , we examine a variety of viewpoints and data . various studies have shown that portfolios comprised primarily of us equity securities have returned approximately 10% ( 10 % ) over long periods of time , while us debt securities have returned approximately 6% ( 6 % ) annually over long periods . application of these historical returns to the plan 2019s allocation of equities and bonds produces a result between 8% ( 8 % ) and 8.5% ( 8.5 % ) and is one point of reference , among many other factors , that is taken into consideration . we also examine the plan 2019s actual historical returns over various periods . recent experience is considered in our evaluation with appropriate consideration that , especially for short time periods , recent returns are not reliable indicators of future returns , and in many cases low returns in recent time periods are followed by higher returns in future periods ( and vice versa ) . acknowledging the potentially wide range for this assumption , we also annually examine the assumption used by other companies with similar pension investment strategies , so that we can ascertain whether our determinations markedly differ from other observers . in all cases , however , this data simply informs our process , which places the greatest emphasis on our qualitative judgment of future investment returns , given the conditions existing at each annual measurement date . the expected long-term return on plan assets for determining net periodic pension cost for 2009 was 8.25% ( 8.25 % ) , unchanged from 2008 . during 2010 , we intend to decrease the midpoint of the plan 2019s target allocation range for equities by approximately five percentage points . as a result of this change and taking into account all other factors described above , pnc will change the expected long-term return on plan assets to 8.00% ( 8.00 % ) for determining net periodic pension cost for 2010 . under current accounting rules , the difference between expected long-term returns and actual returns is accumulated and amortized to pension expense over future periods . each one percentage point difference in actual return compared with our expected return causes expense in subsequent years to change by up to $ 8 million as the impact is amortized into results of operations . the table below reflects the estimated effects on pension expense of certain changes in annual assumptions , using 2010 estimated expense as a baseline . change in assumption ( a ) estimated increase to 2010 pension expense ( in millions ) .

|.5% ( .5 % ) decrease in expected long-term return on assets|$ 18|
|.5% ( .5 % ) increase in compensation rate|$ 3|
( a ) the impact is the effect of changing the specified assumption while holding all other assumptions constant . we currently estimate a pretax pension expense of $ 41 million in 2010 compared with pretax expense of $ 117 million in 2009 . this year-over-year reduction was primarily due to the amortization impact of the favorable 2009 investment returns as compared with the expected long-term return assumption . our pension plan contribution requirements are not particularly sensitive to actuarial assumptions . investment performance has the most impact on contribution requirements and will drive the amount of permitted contributions in future years . also , current law , including the provisions of the pension protection act of 2006 , sets limits as to both minimum and maximum contributions to the plan . we expect that the minimum required contributions under the law will be zero for 2010 . we maintain other defined benefit plans that have a less significant effect on financial results , including various .

( a ) includes collateral related to derivative instruments where an appropriate legal opinion has not been either sought or obtained . derivative receivables reported on the consolidated balance sheets were $ 56.5 billion and $ 64.1 billion at december 31 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively . derivative receivables decreased predominantly as a result of client- driven market-making activities in cib markets , which reduced foreign exchange and interest rate derivative receivables , and increased equity derivative receivables , driven by market movements . derivative receivables amounts represent the fair value of the derivative contracts after giving effect to legally enforceable master netting agreements and cash collateral held by the firm . however , in management 2019s view , the appropriate measure of current credit risk should also take into consideration additional liquid securities ( primarily u.s . government and agency securities and other group of seven nations ( 201cg7 201d ) government bonds ) and other cash collateral held by the firm aggregating $ 16.1 billion and $ 22.7 billion at december 31 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively , that may be used as security when the fair value of the client 2019s exposure is in the firm 2019s favor . in addition to the collateral described in the preceding paragraph , the firm also holds additional collateral ( primarily cash , g7 government securities , other liquid government-agency and guaranteed securities , and corporate debt and equity securities ) delivered by clients at the initiation of transactions , as well as collateral related to contracts that have a non-daily call frequency and collateral that the firm has agreed to return but has not yet settled as of the reporting date . although this collateral does not reduce the balances and is not included in the table above , it is available as security against potential exposure that could arise should the fair value of the client 2019s derivative transactions move in the firm 2019s favor . the derivative receivables fair value , net of all collateral , also does not include other credit enhancements , such as letters of credit . for additional information on the firm 2019s use of collateral agreements , see note 5 . while useful as a current view of credit exposure , the net fair value of the derivative receivables does not capture the potential future variability of that credit exposure . to capture the potential future variability of credit exposure , the firm calculates , on a client-by-client basis , three measures of potential derivatives-related credit loss : peak , derivative risk equivalent ( 201cdre 201d ) , and average exposure ( 201cavg 201d ) . these measures all incorporate netting and collateral benefits , where applicable . peak represents a conservative measure of potential exposure to a counterparty calculated in a manner that is broadly equivalent to a 97.5% ( 97.5 % ) confidence level over the life of the transaction . peak is the primary measure used by the firm for setting of credit limits for derivative transactions , senior management reporting and derivatives exposure management . dre exposure is a measure that expresses the risk of derivative exposure on a basis intended to be equivalent to the risk of loan exposures . dre is a less extreme measure of potential credit loss than peak and is used for aggregating derivative credit risk exposures with loans and other credit risk . finally , avg is a measure of the expected fair value of the firm 2019s derivative receivables at future time periods , including the benefit of collateral . avg exposure over the total life of the derivative contract is used as the primary metric for pricing purposes and is used to calculate credit risk capital and the cva , as further described below . the three year avg exposure was $ 29.0 billion and $ 31.1 billion at december 31 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively , compared with derivative receivables , net of all collateral , of $ 40.4 billion and $ 41.4 billion at december 31 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively . the fair value of the firm 2019s derivative receivables incorporates cva to reflect the credit quality of counterparties . cva is based on the firm 2019s avg to a counterparty and the counterparty 2019s credit spread in the credit derivatives market . the firm believes that active risk management is essential to controlling the dynamic credit risk in the derivatives portfolio . in addition , the firm 2019s risk management process takes into consideration the potential .

2013 vs . 2012 the increase in pension expense , excluding special items , was primarily attributable to the 100 bp decrease in weighted average discount rate , resulting in higher amortization of actuarial losses . the increase was partially offset by a higher expected return on plan assets and contributions in 2013 . special items of $ 19.8 primarily included $ 12.4 for pension settlement losses and $ 6.9 for special termination benefits relating to the 2013 business restructuring and cost reduction plan . 2012 vs . 2011 pension expense in 2012 , excluding special items , was comparable to 2011 expense as a result of no change in the weighted average discount rate from year to year . 2014 outlook pension expense is estimated to be approximately $ 140 to $ 145 , excluding special items , in 2014 , a decrease of $ 5 to $ 10 from 2013 , resulting primarily from an increase in discount rates , partially offset by unfavorable impacts associated with changes in mortality and inflation assumptions . pension settlement losses of $ 10 to $ 25 are expected , dependent on the timing of retirements . in 2014 , pension expense will include approximately $ 118 for amortization of actuarial losses compared to $ 143 in 2013 . net actuarial gains of $ 370.4 were recognized in 2013 , resulting primarily from an approximately 65 bp increase in the weighted average discount rate as well as actual asset returns above expected returns . actuarial gains/losses are amortized into pension expense over prospective periods to the extent they are not offset by future gains or losses . future changes in the discount rate and actual returns on plan assets , different from expected returns , would impact the actuarial gains/losses and resulting amortization in years beyond 2014 . pension funding pension funding includes both contributions to funded plans and benefit payments for unfunded plans , which are primarily non-qualified plans . with respect to funded plans , our funding policy is that contributions , combined with appreciation and earnings , will be sufficient to pay benefits without creating unnecessary surpluses . in addition , we make contributions to satisfy all legal funding requirements while managing our capacity to benefit from tax deductions attributable to plan contributions . with the assistance of third party actuaries , we analyze the liabilities and demographics of each plan , which help guide the level of contributions . during 2013 and 2012 , our cash contributions to funded plans and benefit payments for unfunded plans were $ 300.8 and $ 76.4 , respectively . contributions for 2013 include voluntary contributions for u.s . plans of $ 220.0. .

operating activities cash provided by operating activities is net income adjusted for certain non-cash items and changes in assets and liabilities . for 2017 compared to 2016 , the $ 302 million increase in cash provided by operating activities was due to changes to working capital partially offset by adjustments for non-cash items and lower net income . tax reform did not have an impact on our 2017 cash provided by operating activities . the increase in cash provided by operating activities was driven by increased income before taxes and $ 1.0 billion receipts of customer deposits . these increases were partially offset by increased inventory and accounts receivable . income taxes paid , net of refunds , in 2017 compared to 2016 were $ 2.9 billion higher due to higher income before taxes , taxable gains on sales of asml , and taxes on the isecg divestiture . we expect approximately $ 2.0 billion of additional customer deposits in 2018 . for 2016 compared to 2015 , the $ 2.8 billion increase in cash provided by operating activities was due to adjustments for non-cash items and changes in working capital , partially offset by lower net income . the adjustments for non-cash items were higher in 2016 primarily due to restructuring and other charges and the change in deferred taxes , partially offset by lower depreciation . investing activities investing cash flows consist primarily of capital expenditures ; investment purchases , sales , maturities , and disposals ; and proceeds from divestitures and cash used for acquisitions . our capital expenditures were $ 11.8 billion in 2017 ( $ 9.6 billion in 2016 and $ 7.3 billion in 2015 ) . the decrease in cash used for investing activities in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily due to higher net activity of available-for sale-investments in 2017 , proceeds from our divestiture of isecg in 2017 , and higher maturities and sales of trading assets in 2017 . this activity was partially offset by higher capital expenditures in 2017 . the increase in cash used for investing activities in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to our completed acquisition of altera , net purchases of trading assets in 2016 compared to net sales of trading assets in 2015 , and higher capital expenditures in 2016 . this increase was partially offset by lower investments in non-marketable equity investments . financing activities financing cash flows consist primarily of repurchases of common stock , payment of dividends to stockholders , issuance and repayment of short-term and long-term debt , and proceeds from the sale of shares of common stock through employee equity incentive plans . the increase in cash used for financing activities in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily due to net long-term debt activity , which was a use of cash in 2017 compared to a source of cash in 2016 . during 2017 , we repurchased $ 3.6 billion of common stock under our authorized common stock repurchase program , compared to $ 2.6 billion in 2016 . as of december 30 , 2017 , $ 13.2 billion remained available for repurchasing common stock under the existing repurchase authorization limit . we base our level of common stock repurchases on internal cash management decisions , and this level may fluctuate . proceeds from the sale of common stock through employee equity incentive plans totaled $ 770 million in 2017 compared to $ 1.1 billion in 2016 . our total dividend payments were $ 5.1 billion in 2017 compared to $ 4.9 billion in 2016 . we have paid a cash dividend in each of the past 101 quarters . in january 2018 , our board of directors approved an increase to our cash dividend to $ 1.20 per share on an annual basis . the board has declared a quarterly cash dividend of $ 0.30 per share of common stock for q1 2018 . the dividend is payable on march 1 , 2018 to stockholders of record on february 7 , 2018 . cash was used for financing activities in 2016 compared to cash provided by financing activities in 2015 , primarily due to fewer debt issuances and the repayment of debt in 2016 . this activity was partially offset by repayment of commercial paper in 2015 and fewer common stock repurchases in 2016 . md&a - results of operations consolidated results and analysis 37 .

the aggregate value of which ( the 201cconversion value 201d ) will be deter- mined by multiplying the applicable conversion rate by the average of the daily volume weighted average price of blackrock common stock for each of the ten consecutive trading days beginning on the second trading day imme- diately following the day the debentures are tendered for conversion ( the 201cten-day weighted average price 201d ) . the company will deliver the conversion value to holders as follows : ( 1 ) an amount in cash ( the 201cprincipal return 201d ) equal to the lesser of ( a ) the aggregate conversion value of the debentures to be converted and ( b ) the aggregate principal amount of the debentures to be converted , and ( 2 ) if the aggregate conversion value of the debentures to be converted is greater than the principal return , an amount in shares ( the 201cnet shares 201d ) , determined as set forth below , equal to such aggregate conversion value less the principal return ( the 201cnet share amount 201d ) . the number of net shares to be paid will be determined by dividing the net share amount by the ten-day weighted average price . in lieu of delivering fractional shares , the company will deliver cash based on the ten-day weighted average price . the conversion rate for the debentures is subject to adjustments upon the occurrence of certain corporate events , such as a change of control of the company , 193253ti_txt.indd 96 4/2/10 1:18 pm .

Context: decreased production volume as final aircraft deliveries were completed during the second quarter of 2012 and $ 50 million from the favorable resolution of a contractual matter during the second quarter of 2012 ; and about $ 270 million for various other programs ( primarily sustainment activities ) due to decreased volume . the decreases were partially offset by higher net sales of about $ 295 million for f-35 production contracts due to increased production volume and risk retirements ; approximately $ 245 million for the c-5 program due to increased aircraft deliveries ( six aircraft delivered in 2013 compared to four in 2012 ) and other modernization activities ; and about $ 70 million for the f-35 development contract due to increased volume . aeronautics 2019 operating profit for 2013 decreased $ 87 million , or 5% ( 5 % ) , compared to 2012 . the decrease was primarily attributable to lower operating profit of about $ 85 million for the f-22 program , which includes approximately $ 50 million from the favorable resolution of a contractual matter in the second quarter of 2012 and about $ 35 million due to decreased risk retirements and production volume ; approximately $ 70 million for the c-130 program due to lower risk retirements and fewer deliveries partially offset by increased sustainment activities ; about $ 65 million for the c-5 program due to the inception-to-date effect of reducing the profit booking rate in the third quarter of 2013 and lower risk retirements ; approximately $ 35 million for the f-16 program due to fewer aircraft deliveries partially offset by increased sustainment activity and aircraft configuration mix . the decreases were partially offset by higher operating profit of approximately $ 180 million for f-35 production contracts due to increased risk retirements and volume . operating profit was comparable for the f-35 development contract and included adjustments of approximately $ 85 million to reflect the inception-to-date impacts of the downward revisions to the profit booking rate in both 2013 and 2012 . adjustments not related to volume , including net profit booking rate adjustments and other matters , were approximately $ 75 million lower for 2013 compared to backlog backlog decreased slightly in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to lower orders on f-16 and f-22 programs . backlog decreased in 2013 compared to 2012 mainly due to lower orders on f-16 , c-5 and c-130 programs , partially offset by higher orders on the f-35 program . trends we expect aeronautics 2019 2015 net sales to be comparable or slightly behind 2014 due to a decline in f-16 deliveries as well as a decline in f-35 development activity , partially offset by an increase in production contracts . operating profit is also expected to decrease in the low single digit range , due primarily to contract mix , resulting in a slight decrease in operating margins between years . information systems & global solutions our is&gs business segment provides advanced technology systems and expertise , integrated information technology solutions and management services across a broad spectrum of applications for civil , defense , intelligence and other government customers . is&gs has a portfolio of many smaller contracts as compared to our other business segments . is&gs has been impacted by the continued downturn in certain federal agencies 2019 information technology budgets and increased re-competition on existing contracts coupled with the fragmentation of large contracts into multiple smaller contracts that are awarded primarily on the basis of price . is&gs 2019 operating results included the following ( in millions ) : .

2014 compared to 2013 is&gs 2019 net sales decreased $ 579 million , or 7% ( 7 % ) , for 2014 compared to 2013 . the decrease was primarily attributable to lower net sales of about $ 645 million for 2014 due to the wind-down or completion of certain programs , driven by reductions in direct warfighter support ( including jieddo and ptds ) and defense budgets tied to command and control programs ; and approximately $ 490 million for 2014 due to a decline in volume for various ongoing programs , which reflects lower funding levels and programs impacted by in-theater force reductions . the decreases were partially offset by higher net sales of about $ 550 million for 2014 due to the start-up of new programs , growth in recently awarded programs and integration of recently acquired companies. .

operating expenses increased $ 718 million in 2014 versus 2013 . volume-related expenses , incremental costs associated with operating a slower network , depreciation , wage and benefit inflation , and locomotive and freight car materials contributed to the higher costs . lower fuel price partially offset these increases . in addition , there were approximately $ 35 million of weather related costs in the first quarter of operating expenses increased $ 336 million in 2013 versus 2012 . wage and benefit inflation , new logistics management fees and container costs for our automotive business , locomotive overhauls , property taxes and repairs on jointly owned property contributed to higher expenses during the year . lower fuel prices partially offset the cost increases . compensation and benefits 2013 compensation and benefits include wages , payroll taxes , health and welfare costs , pension costs , other postretirement benefits , and incentive costs . volume-related expenses , including training , and a slower network increased our train and engine work force , which , along with general wage and benefit inflation , drove increased wages . weather-related costs in the first quarter of 2014 also increased costs . general wages and benefits inflation , including increased pension and other postretirement benefits , and higher work force levels drove the increases in 2013 versus 2012 . the impact of ongoing productivity initiatives partially offset these increases . fuel 2013 fuel includes locomotive fuel and gasoline for highway and non-highway vehicles and heavy equipment . volume growth of 7% ( 7 % ) , as measured by gross ton-miles , drove the increase in fuel expense . this was essentially offset by lower locomotive diesel fuel prices , which averaged $ 2.97 per gallon ( including taxes and transportation costs ) in 2014 , compared to $ 3.15 in 2013 , along with a slight improvement in fuel consumption rate , computed as gallons of fuel consumed divided by gross ton-miles . lower locomotive diesel fuel prices , which averaged $ 3.15 per gallon ( including taxes and transportation costs ) in 2013 , compared to $ 3.22 in 2012 , decreased expenses by $ 75 million . volume , as measured by gross ton-miles , decreased 1% ( 1 % ) while the fuel consumption rate , computed as gallons of fuel consumed divided by gross ton-miles , increased 2% ( 2 % ) compared to 2012 . declines in heavier , more fuel-efficient coal shipments drove the variances in gross-ton-miles and the fuel consumption rate . purchased services and materials 2013 expense for purchased services and materials includes the costs of services purchased from outside contractors and other service providers ( including equipment maintenance and contract expenses incurred by our subsidiaries for external transportation services ) ; materials used to maintain the railroad 2019s lines , structures , and equipment ; costs of operating facilities jointly used by uprr and other railroads ; transportation and lodging for train crew employees ; trucking and contracting costs for intermodal containers ; leased automobile maintenance expenses ; and tools and supplies . expenses for purchased services increased 8% ( 8 % ) compared to 2013 primarily due to volume- 2014 operating expenses .

l a c c o u n t i n g p o l i c i e s the preparation of financial statements often requires the selection of specific accounting methods and policies from among several acceptable alternatives . further , significant estimates and judgments may be required in selecting and applying those methods and policies in the recognition of the assets and liabilities in our balance sheet , the revenues and expenses in our statement of income , and the information that is contained in our significant accounting policies and notes to consolidated financial statements . making these estimates and judgments requires the analysis of information concerning events that may not yet be complete and of facts and circumstances that may change over time . accordingly , actual amounts or future results can differ materially from those estimates that we include currently in our consolidated financial statements , significant accounting policies , and notes . we present those significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements as an integral part of those statements within this 2011 annual report . in the following discussion , we highlight and explain further certain of those policies that are most critical to the preparation and understanding of our financial statements . other than temporary impairments of available-for-sale securities . we generally classify our investment holdings in sponsored mutual funds and the debt securities held for investment by our savings bank subsidiary as available-for-sale . at the end of each quarter , we mark the carrying amount of each investment holding to fair value and recognize an unrealized gain or loss as a component of comprehensive income within the statement of stockholders 2019 equity . we next review each individual security position that has an unrealized loss or impairment to determine if that impairment is other than temporary . in determining whether a mutual fund holding is other than temporarily impaired , we consider many factors , including the duration of time it has existed , the severity of the impairment , any subsequent changes in value , and our intent and ability to hold the security for a period of time sufficient for an anticipated recovery in fair value . subject to the other considerations noted above , with respect to duration of time , we believe a mutual fund holding with an unrealized loss that has persisted daily throughout the six months between quarter-ends is generally presumed to have an other than temporary impairment . we may also recognize an other than temporary loss of less than six months in our statement of income if the particular circumstances of the underlying investment do not warrant our belief that a near-term recovery is possible . an impaired debt security held by our savings bank subsidiary is considered to have an other than temporary loss that we will recognize in our statement of income if the impairment is caused by a change in credit quality that affects our ability to recover our amortized cost or if we intend to sell the security or believe that it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovering cost . minor impairments of 5% ( 5 % ) or less are generally considered temporary . other than temporary impairments of equity method investments . we evaluate our equity method investments , including our investment in uti , for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the investment exceeds its fair value , and the decline in fair value is other than temporary . goodwill . we internally conduct , manage and report our operations as one investment advisory business . we do not have distinct operating segments or components that separately constitute a business . accordingly , we attribute goodwill to a single reportable business segment and reporting unit 2014our investment advisory business . we evaluate the carrying amount of goodwill in our balance sheet for possible impairment on an annual basis in the third quarter of each year using a fair value approach . goodwill would be considered impaired whenever our historical carrying amount exceeds the fair value of our investment advisory business . our annual testing has demonstrated that the fair value of our investment advisory business ( our market capitalization ) exceeds our carrying amount ( our stockholders 2019 equity ) and , therefore , no impairment exists . should we reach a different conclusion in the future , additional work would be performed to ascertain the amount of the non-cash impairment charge to be recognized . we must also perform impairment testing at other times if an event or circumstance occurs indicating that it is more likely than not that an impairment has been incurred . the maximum future impairment of goodwill that we could incur is the amount recognized in our balance sheet , $ 665.7 a0million . stock options . we recognize stock option-based compensation expense in our consolidated statement of income using a fair value based method . fair value methods use a valuation model for shorter-term , market-traded financial instruments to theoretically value stock option grants even though they are not available for trading and are of longer duration . the black- scholes option-pricing model that we use includes the input of certain variables that are dependent on future expectations , including the expected lives of our options from grant date to exercise date , the volatility of our underlying common shares in the market over that time period , and the rate of dividends that we will pay during that time . our estimates of these variables are made for the purpose of using the valuation model to determine an expense for each reporting period and are not subsequently adjusted . unlike most of our expenses , the resulting charge to earnings using a fair value based method is a non-cash charge that is never measured by , or adjusted based on , a cash outflow . provision for income taxes . after compensation and related costs , our provision for income taxes on our earnings is our largest annual expense . we operate in numerous states and countries through our various subsidiaries , and must allocate our income , expenses , and earnings under the various laws and regulations of each of these taxing jurisdictions . accordingly , our provision for income taxes represents our total estimate of the liability that we have incurred in doing business each year in all of our locations . annually , we file tax returns that represent our filing positions with each jurisdiction and settle our return liabilities . each jurisdiction has the right to audit those returns and may take different positions with respect to income and expense allocations and taxable earnings determinations . from time to time , we may also provide for estimated liabilities associated with uncertain tax return filing positions that are subject to , or in the process of , being audited by various tax authorities . because the determination of our annual provision is subject to judgments and estimates , it is likely that actual results will vary from those recognized in our financial statements . as a result , we recognize additions to , or reductions of , income tax expense during a reporting period that pertain to prior period provisions as our estimated liabilities are revised and actual tax returns and tax audits are settled . we recognize any such prior period adjustment in the discrete quarterly period in which it is determined . n e w ly i s s u e d b u t n o t y e t a d o p t e d a c c o u n t i n g g u i d a n c e in may 2011 , the fasb issued amended guidance clarifying how to measure and disclose fair value . we do not believe the adoption of such amended guidance on january 1 , 2012 , will have a significant effect on our consolidated financial statements . we have also considered all other newly issued accounting guidance that is applicable to our operations and the preparation of our consolidated statements , including that which we have not yet adopted . we do not believe that any such guidance will have a material effect on our financial position or results of operation. .

proved undeveloped reserves decreased 45% ( 45 % ) from year-end 2014 to year-end 2015 , and the year-end 2015 balance represents 17% ( 17 % ) of total proved reserves . drilling and development activities increased devon 2019s proved undeveloped reserves 24 mmboe and resulted in the conversion of 182 mmboe , or 26% ( 26 % ) , of the 2014 proved undeveloped reserves to proved developed reserves . costs incurred to develop and convert devon 2019s proved undeveloped reserves were approximately $ 2.2 billion for 2015 . additionally , revisions other than price decreased devon 2019s proved undeveloped reserves 120 mmboe primarily due to evaluations of certain properties in the u.s . and canada . the largest revisions , which reduced reserves by 80 mmboe , relate to evaluations of jackfish bitumen reserves . of the 40 mmboe revisions recorded for u.s . properties , a reduction of approximately 27 mmboe represents reserves that devon now does not expect to develop in the next five years , including 20 mmboe attributable to the eagle ford . a significant amount of devon 2019s proved undeveloped reserves at the end of 2015 related to its jackfish operations . at december 31 , 2015 and 2014 , devon 2019s jackfish proved undeveloped reserves were 301 mmboe and 384 mmboe , respectively . development schedules for the jackfish reserves are primarily controlled by the need to keep the processing plants at their 35 mbbl daily facility capacity . processing plant capacity is controlled by factors such as total steam processing capacity and steam-oil ratios . furthermore , development of these projects involves the up-front construction of steam injection/distribution and bitumen processing facilities . due to the large up-front capital investments and large reserves required to provide economic returns , the project conditions meet the specific circumstances requiring a period greater than 5 years for conversion to developed reserves . as a result , these reserves are classified as proved undeveloped for more than five years . currently , the development schedule for these reserves extends through to 2030 . at the end of 2015 , approximately 184 mmboe of proved undeveloped reserves at jackfish have remained undeveloped for five years or more since the initial booking . no other projects have proved undeveloped reserves that have remained undeveloped more than five years from the initial booking of the reserves . furthermore , approximately 180 mmboe of proved undeveloped reserves at jackfish will require in excess of five years , from the date of this filing , to develop . price revisions 2015 2013 reserves decreased 302 mmboe primarily due to lower commodity prices across all products . the lower bitumen price increased canadian reserves due to the decline in royalties , which increases devon 2019s after- royalty volumes . 2014 2013 reserves increased 9 mmboe primarily due to higher gas prices in the barnett shale and the anadarko basin , partially offset by higher bitumen prices , which result in lower after-royalty volumes , in canada. .

Context: management 2019s discussion and analysis 126 jpmorgan chase & co./2014 annual report while useful as a current view of credit exposure , the net fair value of the derivative receivables does not capture the potential future variability of that credit exposure . to capture the potential future variability of credit exposure , the firm calculates , on a client-by-client basis , three measures of potential derivatives-related credit loss : peak , derivative risk equivalent ( 201cdre 201d ) , and average exposure ( 201cavg 201d ) . these measures all incorporate netting and collateral benefits , where applicable . peak exposure to a counterparty is an extreme measure of exposure calculated at a 97.5% ( 97.5 % ) confidence level . dre exposure is a measure that expresses the risk of derivative exposure on a basis intended to be equivalent to the risk of loan exposures . the measurement is done by equating the unexpected loss in a derivative counterparty exposure ( which takes into consideration both the loss volatility and the credit rating of the counterparty ) with the unexpected loss in a loan exposure ( which takes into consideration only the credit rating of the counterparty ) . dre is a less extreme measure of potential credit loss than peak and is the primary measure used by the firm for credit approval of derivative transactions . finally , avg is a measure of the expected fair value of the firm 2019s derivative receivables at future time periods , including the benefit of collateral . avg exposure over the total life of the derivative contract is used as the primary metric for pricing purposes and is used to calculate credit capital and the cva , as further described below . the three year avg exposure was $ 37.5 billion and $ 35.4 billion at december 31 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively , compared with derivative receivables , net of all collateral , of $ 59.4 billion and $ 51.3 billion at december 31 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively . the fair value of the firm 2019s derivative receivables incorporates an adjustment , the cva , to reflect the credit quality of counterparties . the cva is based on the firm 2019s avg to a counterparty and the counterparty 2019s credit spread in the credit derivatives market . the primary components of changes in cva are credit spreads , new deal activity or unwinds , and changes in the underlying market environment . the firm believes that active risk management is essential to controlling the dynamic credit risk in the derivatives portfolio . in addition , the firm 2019s risk management process takes into consideration the potential impact of wrong-way risk , which is broadly defined as the potential for increased correlation between the firm 2019s exposure to a counterparty ( avg ) and the counterparty 2019s credit quality . many factors may influence the nature and magnitude of these correlations over time . to the extent that these correlations are identified , the firm may adjust the cva associated with that counterparty 2019s avg . the firm risk manages exposure to changes in cva by entering into credit derivative transactions , as well as interest rate , foreign exchange , equity and commodity derivative transactions . the accompanying graph shows exposure profiles to the firm 2019s current derivatives portfolio over the next 10 years as calculated by the dre and avg metrics . the two measures generally show that exposure will decline after the first year , if no new trades are added to the portfolio . the following table summarizes the ratings profile by derivative counterparty of the firm 2019s derivative receivables , including credit derivatives , net of other liquid securities collateral , for the dates indicated . the ratings scale is based on the firm 2019s internal ratings , which generally correspond to the ratings as defined by s&p and moody 2019s . ratings profile of derivative receivables rating equivalent 2014 2013 ( a ) december 31 , ( in millions , except ratios ) exposure net of all collateral % (  % ) of exposure net of all collateral exposure net of all collateral % (  % ) of exposure net of all collateral .

( ii ) maintenance of a maximum debt to total capitalization ratio of not greater than 0.35 to 1 . under this covenant , debt does not include trust preferred securities or mezzanine equity , except where the ratio of the sum of trust preferred securities and mezzanine equity to total capitalization is greater than 15 percent . in this circumstance , the amount greater than 15 percent would be included in the debt to total capitalization ratio . at december 31 , 2010 , ( a ) the minimum consolidated net worth requirement under the covenant described in ( i ) above was $ 14.5 billion and our actual consolidated net worth as calculated under that covenant was $ 21.6 billion and ( b ) our ratio of debt to total capitalization was 0.167 to 1 , which is below the maximum debt to total capitalization ratio of 0.35 to 1 as described in ( ii ) above . our failure to comply with the covenants under any credit facility would , subject to grace periods in the case of certain covenants , result in an event of default . this could require us to repay any outstanding borrowings or to cash collateralize locs under such facility . a failure by ace limited ( or any of its subsidiaries ) to pay an obligation due for an amount exceeding $ 50 million would result in an event of default under all of the facilities described above . ratings ace limited and its subsidiaries are assigned debt and financial strength ( insurance ) ratings from internationally recognized rating agencies , including s&p , a.m . best , moody 2019s investors service , and fitch . the ratings issued on our companies by these agencies are announced publicly and are available directly from the agencies . our internet site , www.acegroup.com .

short-term funding our on-balance sheet liquid assets are also an integral component of our liquidity management strategy . these assets provide liquidity through maturities of the assets , but more importantly , they provide us with the ability to raise funds by pledging the securities as collateral for borrowings or through outright sales . in addition , our access to the global capital markets gives us the ability to source incremental funding at reasonable rates of interest from wholesale investors . as discussed earlier under 201casset liquidity , 201d state street bank's membership in the fhlb allows for advances of liquidity with varying terms against high-quality collateral . short-term secured funding also comes in the form of securities lent or sold under agreements to repurchase . these transactions are short-term in nature , generally overnight , and are collateralized by high-quality investment securities . these balances were $ 2.84 billion and $ 4.40 billion as of december 31 , 2017 and december 31 , 2016 , respectively . state street bank currently maintains a line of credit with a financial institution of cad 1.40 billion , or approximately $ 1.11 billion as of december 31 , 2017 , to support its canadian securities processing operations . the line of credit has no stated termination date and is cancelable by either party with prior notice . as of december 31 , 2017 , there was no balance outstanding on this line of credit . long-term funding we have the ability to issue debt and equity securities under our current universal shelf registration to meet current commitments and business needs , including accommodating the transaction and cash management needs of our clients . in addition , state street bank , a wholly owned subsidiary of the parent company , also has authorization to issue up to $ 5 billion in unsecured senior debt and an additional $ 500 million of subordinated debt . agency credit ratings our ability to maintain consistent access to liquidity is fostered by the maintenance of high investment-grade ratings as measured by the major independent credit rating agencies . factors essential to maintaining high credit ratings include : 2022 diverse and stable core earnings ; 2022 relative market position ; 2022 strong risk management ; 2022 strong capital ratios ; 2022 diverse liquidity sources , including the global capital markets and client deposits ; 2022 strong liquidity monitoring procedures ; and 2022 preparedness for current or future regulatory developments . high ratings limit borrowing costs and enhance our liquidity by : 2022 providing assurance for unsecured funding and depositors ; 2022 increasing the potential market for our debt and improving our ability to offer products ; 2022 serving markets ; and 2022 engaging in transactions in which clients value high credit ratings . a downgrade or reduction of our credit ratings could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity by restricting our ability to access the capital markets , which could increase the related cost of funds . in turn , this could cause the sudden and large-scale withdrawal of unsecured deposits by our clients , which could lead to draw-downs of unfunded commitments to extend credit or trigger requirements under securities purchase commitments ; or require additional collateral or force terminations of certain trading derivative contracts . a majority of our derivative contracts have been entered into under bilateral agreements with counterparties who may require us to post collateral or terminate the transactions based on changes in our credit ratings . we assess the impact of these arrangements by determining the collateral that would be required assuming a downgrade by all rating agencies . the additional collateral or termination payments related to our net derivative liabilities under these arrangements that could have been called by counterparties in the event of a downgrade in our credit ratings below levels specified in the agreements is disclosed in note 10 to the consolidated financial statements included under item 8 , financial statements and supplementary data , of this form 10-k . other funding sources , such as secured financing transactions and other margin requirements , for which there are no explicit triggers , could also be adversely affected. .

Context: the company endeavors to actively engage with every insured account posing significant potential asbestos exposure to mt . mckinley . such engagement can take the form of pursuing a final settlement , negotiation , litigation , or the monitoring of claim activity under settlement in place ( 201csip 201d ) agreements . sip agreements generally condition an insurer 2019s payment upon the actual claim experience of the insured and may have annual payment caps or other measures to control the insurer 2019s payments . the company 2019s mt . mckinley operation is currently managing four sip agreements , one of which was executed prior to the acquisition of mt . mckinley in 2000 . the company 2019s preference with respect to coverage settlements is to execute settlements that call for a fixed schedule of payments , because such settlements eliminate future uncertainty . the company has significantly enhanced its classification of insureds by exposure characteristics over time , as well as its analysis by insured for those it considers to be more exposed or active . those insureds identified as relatively less exposed or active are subject to less rigorous , but still active management , with an emphasis on monitoring those characteristics , which may indicate an increasing exposure or levels of activity . the company continually focuses on further enhancement of the detailed estimation processes used to evaluate potential exposure of policyholders . everest re 2019s book of assumed a&e reinsurance is relatively concentrated within a limited number of contracts and for a limited period , from 1974 to 1984 . because the book of business is relatively concentrated and the company has been managing the a&e exposures for many years , its claim staff is familiar with the ceding companies that have generated most of these liabilities in the past and which are therefore most likely to generate future liabilities . the company 2019s claim staff has developed familiarity both with the nature of the business written by its ceding companies and the claims handling and reserving practices of those companies . this level of familiarity enhances the quality of the company 2019s analysis of its exposure through those companies . as a result , the company believes that it can identify those claims on which it has unusual exposure , such as non-products asbestos claims , for concentrated attention . however , in setting reserves for its reinsurance liabilities , the company relies on claims data supplied , both formally and informally by its ceding companies and brokers . this furnished information is not always timely or accurate and can impact the accuracy and timeliness of the company 2019s ultimate loss projections . the following table summarizes the composition of the company 2019s total reserves for a&e losses , gross and net of reinsurance , for the periods indicated: .
|( dollars in millions )|years ended december 31 , 2012|years ended december 31 , 2011|years ended december 31 , 2010|
|case reserves reported by ceding companies|$ 138.4|$ 145.6|$ 135.4|

|net reserves|$ 425.7|$ 480.2|$ 532.9|
( 1 ) additional reserves are case specific reserves established by the company in excess of those reported by the ceding company , based on the company 2019s assessment of the covered loss . ( some amounts may not reconcile due to rounding. ) additional losses , including those relating to latent injuries and other exposures , which are as yet unrecognized , the type or magnitude of which cannot be foreseen by either the company or the industry , may emerge in the future . such future emergence could have material adverse effects on the company 2019s future financial condition , results of operations and cash flows. .

( a ) number of subscribers corresponds to the sum of the subscribers to each of the nordic broadcast networks in sweden , norway , finland and denmark subject to retransmission agreements with pay-tv providers . the nordic broadcast networks include kanal 5 , kanal 9 , and kanal 11 in sweden , tv norge , max , fem and vox in norway , tv 5 , kutonen , and frii in finland , and kanal 4 , kanal 5 , 6'eren , and canal 9 in denmark . similar to u.s . networks , a significant source of revenue for international networks relates to fees charged to operators who distribute our linear networks . such operators primarily include cable and dth satellite service providers , internet protocol television ( ""iptv"" ) and over-the-top operators ( ""ott"" ) . international television markets vary in their stages of development . some markets , such as the u.k. , are more advanced digital television markets , while others remain in the analog environment with varying degrees of investment from operators to expand channel capacity or convert to digital technologies . common practice in international markets results in long-term contractual distribution relationships with terms generally shorter than similar customers in the u.s . distribution revenue for our international networks segment is largely dependent on the number of subscribers that receive our networks or content , the rates negotiated in the distributor agreements , and the market demand for the content that we provide . the other significant source of revenue for international networks relates to advertising sold on our television networks and across other distribution platforms , similar to u.s . networks . advertising revenue is dependent upon a number of factors , including the development of pay and fta television markets , the number of subscribers to and viewers of our channels , viewership demographics , the popularity of our programming , and our ability to sell commercial time over all media platforms . in certain markets , our advertising sales business operates with in-house sales teams , while we rely on external sales representation services in other markets . during 2017 , distribution , advertising and other revenues were 57% ( 57 % ) , 41% ( 41 % ) and 2% ( 2 % ) , respectively , of total net revenues for this segment . while the company has traditionally operated cable networks , in recent years an increasing portion of the company's international advertising revenue is generated by fta or broadcast networks , unlike u.s . networks . during 2017 , fta or broadcast networks generated 54% ( 54 % ) of international networks' advertising revenue and pay-tv networks generated 46% ( 46 % ) of international networks' advertising revenue . international networks' largest cost is content expense for localized programming disseminated via more than 400 unique distribution feeds . while our international networks segment maximizes the use of programming from u.s . networks , we also develop local programming that is tailored to individual market preferences and license the rights to air films , television series and sporting events from third parties . international networks amortizes the cost of capitalized content rights based on the proportion of current estimated revenues relative to the estimated remaining total lifetime revenues , which results in either an accelerated method or a straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the content of up to five years . content acquired from u.s . networks and content developed locally airing on the same network is amortized similarly , as amortization rates vary by network . more than half of international networks' content is amortized using an accelerated amortization method , while the remainder is amortized on a straight-line basis . the costs for multi-year sports programming arrangements are expensed when the event is broadcast based on the estimated relative value of each component of the arrangement . while international networks and u.s . networks have similarities with respect to the nature of operations , the generation of revenue and the categories of expense , international networks have a lower segment margin due to lower economies of scale from being in over 220 markets requiring additional cost for localization to satisfy market variations . international networks also include sports and fta broadcast channels , which drive higher costs from sports rights and production and investment in broad entertainment programming for broadcast networks . on june 23 , 2016 , the u.k . held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the european union ( 201ce.u . 201d ) , commonly referred to as 201cbrexit . 201d after a preliminary phase of negotiations towards the end of 2017 , the u.k . government and the e.u . will in 2018 negotiate the main principles of the u.k . 2019s future relationship with the e.u. , as well as a transitional period . brexit may have an adverse impact on advertising , subscribers , distributors and employees , as described in item 1a , risk factors , below . we continue to monitor the situation and plan for potential effects to our distribution and licensing agreements , unusual foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations , and changes to the legal and regulatory landscape . education and other education and other generated revenues of $ 158 million during 2017 , which represented 2% ( 2 % ) of our total consolidated revenues . education is comprised of curriculum-based product and service offerings and generates revenues primarily from subscriptions charged to k-12 schools for access to an online suite of curriculum-based vod tools , professional development services , digital textbooks and , to a lesser extent , student assessments and publication of hard copy curriculum-based content . other is comprised of our wholly-owned production studio , which provides services to our u.s . networks and international networks segments at cost . on february 26 , 2018 , the company announced the planned sale of a controlling equity stake in its education business in the first half of 2018 , to francisco partners for cash of $ 120 million . no loss is expected upon sale . the company will retain an equity interest . additionally , the company will have ongoing license agreements which are considered to be at fair value . as of december 31 , 2017 , the company determined that the education business did not meet the held for sale criteria , as defined in gaap as management had not committed to a plan to sell the assets . on april 28 , 2017 , the company sold raw and betty to all3media . all3media is a u.k . based television , film and digital production and distribution company . the company owns 50% ( 50 % ) of all3media and accounts for its investment in all3media under the equity method of accounting . raw and betty were components of the studios operating segment reported with education and other . on november 12 , 2015 , we paid $ 195 million to acquire 5 million shares , or approximately 3% ( 3 % ) , of lions gate entertainment corp . ( ""lionsgate"" ) , an entertainment company involved in the production of movies and television which is accounted for as an available-for-sale ( ""afs"" ) security . during 2016 , we determined that the decline in value of our investment in lionsgate is other- than-temporary in nature and , as such , the cost basis was adjusted to the fair value of the investment as of september 30 , 2016 . ( see note 4 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. ) content development our content development strategy is designed to increase viewership , maintain innovation and quality leadership , and provide value for our network distributors and advertising customers . our content is sourced from a wide range of third-party producers , which include some of the world 2019s leading nonfiction production companies , as well as independent producers and wholly-owned production studios . our production arrangements fall into three categories : produced , coproduced and licensed . produced content includes content that we engage third parties or wholly owned production studios to develop and produce . we retain editorial control and own most or all of the rights , in exchange for paying all development and production costs . production of digital-first content such as virtual reality and short-form video is typically done through wholly-owned production studios . coproduced content refers to program rights on which we have collaborated with third parties to finance and develop either because at times world-wide rights are not available for acquisition or we save costs by collaborating with third parties . licensed content is comprised of films or .

Context: underlying physical transaction occurs . we have not qualified commodity derivative instruments used in our osm or rm&t segments for hedge accounting . as a result , we recognize in net income all changes in the fair value of derivative instruments used in those operations . open commodity derivative positions as of december 31 , 2008 and sensitivity analysis at december 31 , 2008 , our e&p segment held open derivative contracts to mitigate the price risk on natural gas held in storage or purchased to be marketed with our own natural gas production in amounts that were in line with normal levels of activity . at december 31 , 2008 , we had no significant open derivative contracts related to our future sales of liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas and therefore remained substantially exposed to market prices of these commodities . the osm segment holds crude oil options which were purchased by western for a three year period ( january 2007 to december 2009 ) . the premiums for the purchased put options had been partially offset through the sale of call options for the same three-year period , resulting in a net premium liability . payment of the net premium liability is deferred until the settlement of the option contracts . as of december 31 , 2008 , the following put and call options were outstanding: .

|call options|$ 90.50|
in the first quarter of 2009 , we sold derivative instruments at an average exercise price of $ 50.50 which effectively offset the open put options for the remainder of 2009 . at december 31 , 2008 , the number of open derivative contracts held by our rm&t segment was lower than in previous periods . starting in the second quarter of 2008 , we decreased our use of derivatives to mitigate crude oil price risk between the time that domestic spot crude oil purchases are priced and when they are actually refined into salable petroleum products . instead , we are addressing this price risk through other means , including changes in contractual terms and crude oil acquisition practices . additionally , in previous periods , certain contracts in our rm&t segment for the purchase or sale of commodities were not qualified or designated as normal purchase or normal sales under generally accepted accounting principles and therefore were accounted for as derivative instruments . during the second quarter of 2008 , as we decreased our use of derivatives , we began to designate such contracts for the normal purchase and normal sale exclusion. .

our losses from future catastrophic events could exceed our projections . we use projections of possible losses from future catastrophic events of varying types and magnitudes as a strategic underwriting tool . we use these loss projections to estimate our potential catastrophe losses in certain geographic areas and decide on the placement of retrocessional coverage or other actions to limit the extent of potential losses in a given geographic area . these loss projections are approximations , reliant on a mix of quantitative and qualitative processes , and actual losses may exceed the projections by a material amount , resulting in a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. .

( 201cmetric 201d ) , a subsidiary of blackrock realty advisors , inc . ( 201crealty 201d ) . prior to the transfer in 2008 , these employees were retained on metric 2019s payroll when certain properties were acquired by realty 2019s clients . the related compensation and benefits were fully reimbursed by realty 2019s clients and have been excluded from revenue used for operating margin , as adjusted , because they did not bear an economic cost to blackrock . for each of these items , blackrock excludes from revenue used for operating margin , as adjusted , the costs related to each of these items as a proxy for such offsetting revenues .

oil sands mining segment we hold a 20 percent non-operated interest in the aosp , an oil sands mining and upgrading joint venture located in alberta , canada . the joint venture produces bitumen from oil sands deposits in the athabasca region utilizing mining techniques and upgrades the bitumen to synthetic crude oils and vacuum gas oil . the aosp 2019s mining and extraction assets are located near fort mcmurray , alberta , and include the muskeg river and the jackpine mines . gross design capacity of the combined mines is 255000 ( 51000 net to our interest ) barrels of bitumen per day . the aosp operations use established processes to mine oil sands deposits from an open-pit mine , extract the bitumen and upgrade it into synthetic crude oils . ore is mined using traditional truck and shovel mining techniques . the mined ore passes through primary crushers to reduce the ore chunks in size and is then sent to rotary breakers where the ore chunks are further reduced to smaller particles . the particles are combined with hot water to create slurry . the slurry moves through the extraction process where it separates into sand , clay and bitumen-rich froth . a solvent is added to the bitumen froth to separate out the remaining solids , water and heavy asphaltenes . the solvent washes the sand and produces clean bitumen that is required for the upgrader to run efficiently . the process yields a mixture of solvent and bitumen which is then transported from the mine to the scotford upgrader via the approximately 300-mile corridor pipeline . the aosp's scotford upgrader is located at fort saskatchewan , northeast of edmonton , alberta . the bitumen is upgraded at scotford using both hydrotreating and hydroconversion processes to remove sulfur and break the heavy bitumen molecules into lighter products . blendstocks acquired from outside sources are utilized in the production of our saleable products . the upgrader produces synthetic crude oils and vacuum gas oil . the vacuum gas oil is sold to an affiliate of the operator under a long-term contract at market-related prices , and the other products are sold in the marketplace . as of december 31 , 2014 , we own or have rights to participate in developed and undeveloped leases totaling approximately 163000 gross ( 33000 net ) acres . the underlying developed leases are held for the duration of the project , with royalties payable to the province of alberta . synthetic crude oil sales volumes for 2014 averaged 50 mbbld and net-of-royalty production was 41 mbbld . in december 2013 , a jackpine mine expansion project received conditional approval from the canadian government . the project includes additional mining areas , associated processing facilities and infrastructure . the government conditions relate to wildlife , the environment and aboriginal health issues . we will evaluate the potential expansion project and government conditions after infrastructure reliability initiatives are completed . the governments of alberta and canada have agreed to partially fund quest ccs for $ 865 million canadian . in the third quarter of 2012 , the energy and resources conservation board ( ""ercb"" ) , alberta's primary energy regulator at that time , conditionally approved the project and the aosp partners approved proceeding to construct and operate quest ccs . government funding commenced in 2012 and continued as milestones were achieved during the development , construction and operating phases . failure of the aosp to meet certain timing , performance and operating objectives may result in repaying some of the government funding . construction and commissioning of quest ccs is expected to be completed by late 2015. .

Context: the income approach indicates value for an asset or liability based on the present value of cash flow projected to be generated over the remaining economic life of the asset or liability being measured . both the amount and the duration of the cash flows are considered from a market participant perspective . our estimates of market participant net cash flows considered historical and projected pricing , remaining developmental effort , operational performance including company- specific synergies , aftermarket retention , product life cycles , material and labor pricing , and other relevant customer , contractual and market factors . where appropriate , the net cash flows are adjusted to reflect the uncertainties associated with the underlying assumptions , as well as the risk profile of the net cash flows utilized in the valuation . the adjusted future cash flows are then discounted to present value using an appropriate discount rate . projected cash flow is discounted at a required rate of return that reflects the relative risk of achieving the cash flows and the time value of money . the market approach is a valuation technique that uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets , liabilities , or a group of assets and liabilities . valuation techniques consistent with the market approach often use market multiples derived from a set of comparables . the cost approach , which estimates value by determining the current cost of replacing an asset with another of equivalent economic utility , was used , as appropriate , for property , plant and equipment . the cost to replace a given asset reflects the estimated reproduction or replacement cost , less an allowance for loss in value due to depreciation . the purchase price allocation resulted in the recognition of $ 2.8 billion of goodwill , all of which is expected to be amortizable for tax purposes . substantially all of the goodwill was assigned to our rms business . the goodwill recognized is attributable to expected revenue synergies generated by the integration of our products and technologies with those of sikorsky , costs synergies resulting from the consolidation or elimination of certain functions , and intangible assets that do not qualify for separate recognition , such as the assembled workforce of sikorsky . determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires the exercise of significant judgments , including the amount and timing of expected future cash flows , long-term growth rates and discount rates . the cash flows employed in the dcf analyses are based on our best estimate of future sales , earnings and cash flows after considering factors such as general market conditions , customer budgets , existing firm orders , expected future orders , contracts with suppliers , labor agreements , changes in working capital , long term business plans and recent operating performance . use of different estimates and judgments could yield different results . impact to 2015 financial results sikorsky 2019s 2015 financial results have been included in our consolidated financial results only for the period from the november 6 , 2015 acquisition date through december 31 , 2015 . as a result , our consolidated financial results for the year ended december 31 , 2015 do not reflect a full year of sikorsky 2019s results . from the november 6 , 2015 acquisition date through december 31 , 2015 , sikorsky generated net sales of approximately $ 400 million and operating loss of approximately $ 45 million , inclusive of intangible amortization and adjustments required to account for the acquisition . we incurred approximately $ 38 million of non-recoverable transaction costs associated with the sikorsky acquisition in 2015 that were expensed as incurred . these costs are included in other income , net on our consolidated statements of earnings . we also incurred approximately $ 48 million in costs associated with issuing the $ 7.0 billion november 2015 notes used to repay all outstanding borrowings under the 364-day facility used to finance the acquisition . the financing costs were recorded as a reduction of debt and will be amortized to interest expense over the term of the related debt . supplemental pro forma financial information ( unaudited ) the following table presents summarized unaudited pro forma financial information as if sikorsky had been included in our financial results for the entire years in 2015 and 2014 ( in millions ) : .

Context: part ii on november 1 , 2011 , we entered into a committed credit facility agreement with a syndicate of banks which provides for up to $ 1 billion of borrowings with the option to increase borrowings to $ 1.5 billion with lender approval . following an extension agreement on september 17 , 2013 between the company and the syndicate of banks , the facility matures november 1 , 2017 , with a one-year extension option exercisable through october 31 , 2014 . no amounts were outstanding under this facility as of may 31 , 2014 or 2013 . we currently have long-term debt ratings of aa- and a1 from standard and poor 2019s corporation and moody 2019s investor services , respectively . if our long- term debt rating were to decline , the facility fee and interest rate under our committed credit facility would increase . conversely , if our long-term debt rating were to improve , the facility fee and interest rate would decrease . changes in our long-term debt rating would not trigger acceleration of maturity of any then-outstanding borrowings or any future borrowings under the committed credit facility . under this committed revolving credit facility , we have agreed to various covenants . these covenants include limits on our disposal of fixed assets , the amount of debt secured by liens we may incur , as well as a minimum capitalization ratio . in the event we were to have any borrowings outstanding under this facility and failed to meet any covenant , and were unable to obtain a waiver from a majority of the banks in the syndicate , any borrowings would become immediately due and payable . as of may 31 , 2014 , we were in full compliance with each of these covenants and believe it is unlikely we will fail to meet any of these covenants in the foreseeable future . liquidity is also provided by our $ 1 billion commercial paper program . during the year ended may 31 , 2014 , we did not issue commercial paper , and as of may 31 , 2014 , there were no outstanding borrowings under this program . we may continue to issue commercial paper or other debt securities during fiscal 2015 depending on general corporate needs . we currently have short-term debt ratings of a1+ and p1 from standard and poor 2019s corporation and moody 2019s investor services , respectively . as of may 31 , 2014 , we had cash , cash equivalents , and short-term investments totaling $ 5.1 billion , of which $ 2.5 billion was held by our foreign subsidiaries . cash equivalents and short-term investments consist primarily of deposits held at major banks , money market funds , commercial paper , corporate notes , u.s . treasury obligations , u.s . government sponsored enterprise obligations , and other investment grade fixed income securities . our fixed income investments are exposed to both credit and interest rate risk . all of our investments are investment grade to minimize our credit risk . while individual securities have varying durations , as of may 31 , 2014 the average duration of our short-term investments and cash equivalents portfolio was 126 days . to date we have not experienced difficulty accessing the credit markets or incurred higher interest costs . future volatility in the capital markets , however , may increase costs associated with issuing commercial paper or other debt instruments or affect our ability to access those markets . we believe that existing cash , cash equivalents , short-term investments , and cash generated by operations , together with access to external sources of funds as described above , will be sufficient to meet our domestic and foreign capital needs in the foreseeable future . we utilize a variety of tax planning and financing strategies to manage our worldwide cash and deploy funds to locations where they are needed . we routinely repatriate a portion of our foreign earnings for which u.s . taxes have previously been provided . we also indefinitely reinvest a significant portion of our foreign earnings , and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate these earnings . should we require additional capital in the united states , we may elect to repatriate indefinitely reinvested foreign funds or raise capital in the united states through debt . if we were to repatriate indefinitely reinvested foreign funds , we would be required to accrue and pay additional u.s . taxes less applicable foreign tax credits . if we elect to raise capital in the united states through debt , we would incur additional interest expense . off-balance sheet arrangements in connection with various contracts and agreements , we routinely provide indemnification relating to the enforceability of intellectual property rights , coverage for legal issues that arise and other items where we are acting as the guarantor . currently , we have several such agreements in place . however , based on our historical experience and the estimated probability of future loss , we have determined that the fair value of such indemnification is not material to our financial position or results of operations . contractual obligations our significant long-term contractual obligations as of may 31 , 2014 and significant endorsement contracts entered into through the date of this report are as follows: .

the company and certain of its subsidiaries are currently under examination by the relevant taxing authorities for various tax years . the company regularly assesses the potential outcome of these examinations in each of the taxing jurisdictions when determining the adequacy of the amount of unrecognized tax benefit recorded . while it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular uncertain tax position , we believe we have appropriately accrued for our uncertain tax benefits . however , audit outcomes and the timing of audit settlements and future events that would impact our previously recorded unrecognized tax benefits and the range of anticipated increases or decreases in unrecognized tax benefits are subject to significant uncertainty . it is possible that the ultimate outcome of current or future examinations may exceed our provision for current unrecognized tax benefits in amounts that could be material , but cannot be estimated as of december 31 , 2017 . our effective tax rate and net income in any given future period could therefore be materially impacted . 21 . discontinued operations due to a portfolio evaluation in the first half of 2016 , management decided to pursue a strategic shift of its distribution companies in brazil , sul and eletropaulo , to reduce the company's exposure to the brazilian distribution market . eletropaulo 2014 in november 2017 , eletropaulo converted its preferred shares into ordinary shares and transitioned the listing of those shares into the novo mercado , which is a listing segment of the brazilian stock exchange with the highest standards of corporate governance . upon conversion of the preferred shares into ordinary shares , aes no longer controlled eletropaulo , but maintained significant influence over the business . as a result , the company deconsolidated eletropaulo . after deconsolidation , the company's 17% ( 17 % ) ownership interest is reflected as an equity method investment . the company recorded an after-tax loss on deconsolidation of $ 611 million , which primarily consisted of $ 455 million related to cumulative translation losses and $ 243 million related to pension losses reclassified from aocl . in december 2017 , all the remaining criteria were met for eletropaulo to qualify as a discontinued operation . therefore , its results of operations and financial position were reported as such in the consolidated financial statements for all periods presented . eletropaulo's pre-tax loss attributable to aes , including the loss on deconsolidation , for the years ended december 31 , 2017 and 2016 was $ 633 million and $ 192 million , respectively . eletropaulo's pre-tax income attributable to aes for the year ended december 31 , 2015 was $ 73 million . prior to its classification as discontinued operations , eletropaulo was reported in the brazil sbu reportable segment . sul 2014 the company executed an agreement for the sale of sul , a wholly-owned subsidiary , in june 2016 . the results of operations and financial position of sul are reported as discontinued operations in the consolidated financial statements for all periods presented . upon meeting the held-for-sale criteria , the company recognized an after-tax loss of $ 382 million comprised of a pre-tax impairment charge of $ 783 million , offset by a tax benefit of $ 266 million related to the impairment of the sul long lived assets and a tax benefit of $ 135 million for deferred taxes related to the investment in sul . prior to the impairment charge , the carrying value of the sul asset group of $ 1.6 billion was greater than its approximate fair value less costs to sell . however , the impairment charge was limited to the carrying value of the long lived assets of the sul disposal group . on october 31 , 2016 , the company completed the sale of sul and received final proceeds less costs to sell of $ 484 million , excluding contingent consideration . upon disposal of sul , the company incurred an additional after-tax .

in addition to the collateral amounts reflected in the table above , at december 31 , 2010 and 2009 , the firm had received liquid securi- ties and other cash collateral in the amount of $ 16.5 billion and $ 15.5 billion , respectively , and had posted $ 10.9 billion and $ 11.7 billion , respectively . the firm also receives and delivers collateral at the initiation of derivative transactions , which is available as secu- rity against potential exposure that could arise should the fair value of the transactions move in the firm 2019s or client 2019s favor , respectively . furthermore , the firm and its counterparties hold collateral related to contracts that have a non-daily call frequency for collateral to be posted , and collateral that the firm or a counterparty has agreed to return but has not yet settled as of the reporting date . at december 31 , 2010 and 2009 , the firm had received $ 18.0 billion and $ 16.9 billion , respectively , and delivered $ 8.4 billion and $ 5.8 billion , respectively , of such additional collateral . these amounts were not netted against the derivative receivables and payables in the table above , because , at an individual counterparty level , the collateral exceeded the fair value exposure at december 31 , 2010 and 2009 . credit derivatives credit derivatives are financial instruments whose value is derived from the credit risk associated with the debt of a third-party issuer ( the reference entity ) and which allow one party ( the protection purchaser ) to transfer that risk to another party ( the protection seller ) . credit derivatives expose the protection purchaser to the creditworthiness of the protection seller , as the protection seller is required to make payments under the contract when the reference entity experiences a credit event , such as a bankruptcy , a failure to pay its obligation or a restructuring . the seller of credit protection receives a premium for providing protection but has the risk that the underlying instrument referenced in the contract will be subject to a credit event . the firm is both a purchaser and seller of protection in the credit derivatives market and uses these derivatives for two primary purposes . first , in its capacity as a market-maker in the dealer/client business , the firm actively risk manages a portfolio of credit derivatives by purchasing and selling credit protection , pre- dominantly on corporate debt obligations , to meet the needs of customers . as a seller of protection , the firm 2019s exposure to a given reference entity may be offset partially , or entirely , with a contract to purchase protection from another counterparty on the same or similar reference entity . second , the firm uses credit derivatives to mitigate credit risk associated with its overall derivative receivables and traditional commercial credit lending exposures ( loans and unfunded commitments ) as well as to manage its exposure to residential and commercial mortgages . see note 3 on pages 170 2013 187 of this annual report for further information on the firm 2019s mortgage-related exposures . in accomplishing the above , the firm uses different types of credit derivatives . following is a summary of various types of credit derivatives . credit default swaps credit derivatives may reference the credit of either a single refer- ence entity ( 201csingle-name 201d ) or a broad-based index . the firm purchases and sells protection on both single- name and index- reference obligations . single-name cds and index cds contracts are otc derivative contracts . single-name cds are used to manage the default risk of a single reference entity , while index cds con- tracts are used to manage the credit risk associated with the broader credit markets or credit market segments . like the s&p 500 and other market indices , a cds index comprises a portfolio of cds across many reference entities . new series of cds indices are periodically established with a new underlying portfolio of reference entities to reflect changes in the credit markets . if one of the refer- ence entities in the index experiences a credit event , then the reference entity that defaulted is removed from the index . cds can also be referenced against specific portfolios of reference names or against customized exposure levels based on specific client de- mands : for example , to provide protection against the first $ 1 million of realized credit losses in a $ 10 million portfolio of expo- sure . such structures are commonly known as tranche cds . for both single-name cds contracts and index cds contracts , upon the occurrence of a credit event , under the terms of a cds contract neither party to the cds contract has recourse to the reference entity . the protection purchaser has recourse to the protection seller for the difference between the face value of the cds contract and the fair value of the reference obligation at the time of settling the credit derivative contract , also known as the recovery value . the protection purchaser does not need to hold the debt instrument of the underlying reference entity in order to receive amounts due under the cds contract when a credit event occurs . credit-related notes a credit-related note is a funded credit derivative where the issuer of the credit-related note purchases from the note investor credit protec- tion on a referenced entity . under the contract , the investor pays the issuer the par value of the note at the inception of the transaction , and in return , the issuer pays periodic payments to the investor , based on the credit risk of the referenced entity . the issuer also repays the investor the par value of the note at maturity unless the reference entity experiences a specified credit event . if a credit event .

the unrecognized prior service cost at december 31 , 2013 was $ 27 million in the u.k . and other plans . for the u.s . pension plans we use a market-related valuation of assets approach to determine the expected return on assets , which is a component of net periodic benefit cost recognized in the consolidated statements of income . this approach recognizes 20% ( 20 % ) of any gains or losses in the current year's value of market-related assets , with the remaining 80% ( 80 % ) spread over the next four years . as this approach recognizes gains or losses over a five-year period , the future value of assets and therefore , our net periodic benefit cost will be impacted as previously deferred gains or losses are recorded . as of december 31 , 2013 , the market-related value of assets was $ 1.8 billion . we do not use the market-related valuation approach to determine the funded status of the u.s . plans recorded in the consolidated statements of financial position . instead , we record and present the funded status in the consolidated statements of financial position based on the fair value of the plan assets . as of december 31 , 2013 , the fair value of plan assets was $ 1.9 billion . our non-u.s . plans use fair value to determine expected return on assets. .

Context: has decreased during the period from 2002 to 2004 , principally due to the increase in earned premium and due to cost containment measures undertaken by management . in business insurance and personal lines , the expense ratio is expected to decrease further in 2005 , largely as a result of expected increases in earned premium . in specialty commercial , the expense ratio is expected to increase slightly in 2005 due to changes in the business mix , most notably the company 2019s decision in the fourth quarter of 2004 to exit the multi-peril crop insurance program which will eliminate significant expense reimbursements from the specialty commercial segment . policyholder dividend ratio : the policyholder dividend ratio is the ratio of policyholder dividends to earned premium . combined ratio : the combined ratio is the sum of the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio , the expense ratio and the policyholder dividend ratio . this ratio is a relative measurement that describes the related cost of losses and expense for every $ 100 of earned premiums . a combined ratio below 100.0 demonstrates underwriting profit ; a combined ratio above 100.0 demonstrates underwriting losses . the combined ratio has decreased from 2003 to 2004 primarily because of improvement in the expense ratio . the combined ratio in 2005 could be significantly higher or lower than the 2004 combined ratio depending on the level of catastrophe losses , but will also be impacted by changes in pricing and an expected moderation in favorable loss cost trends . catastrophe ratio : the catastrophe ratio ( a component of the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio ) represents the ratio of catastrophe losses ( net of reinsurance ) to earned premiums . a catastrophe is an event that causes $ 25 or more in industry insured property losses and affects a significant number of property and casualty policyholders and insurers . by their nature , catastrophe losses vary dramatically from year to year . based on the mix and geographic dispersion of premium written and estimates derived from various catastrophe loss models , the company 2019s expected catastrophe ratio over the long-term is 3.0 points . before considering the reduction in ongoing operation 2019s catastrophe reserves related to september 11 of $ 298 in 2004 , the catastrophe ratio in 2004 was 5.3 points . see 201crisk management strategy 201d below for a discussion of the company 2019s property catastrophe risk management program that serves to mitigate the company 2019s net exposure to catastrophe losses . combined ratio before catastrophes and prior accident year development : the combined ratio before catastrophes and prior accident year development represents the combined ratio for the current accident year , excluding the impact of catastrophes . the company believes this ratio is an important measure of the trend in profitability since it removes the impact of volatile and unpredictable catastrophe losses and prior accident year reserve development . before considering catastrophes , the combined ratio related to current accident year business has improved from 2002 to 2004 principally due to earned pricing increases and favorable claim frequency . other operations underwriting results : the other operations segment is responsible for managing operations of the hartford that have discontinued writing new or renewal business as well as managing the claims related to asbestos and environmental exposures . as such , neither earned premiums nor underwriting ratios are meaningful financial measures . instead , management believes that underwriting result is a more meaningful measure . the net underwriting loss for 2002 through 2004 is primarily due to prior accident year loss development , including $ 2.6 billion of net asbestos reserve strengthening in 2003 . reserve estimates within other operations , including estimates for asbestos and environmental claims , are inherently uncertain . refer to the other operations segment md&a for further discussion of other operation's underwriting results . total property & casualty investment earnings .

the investment return , or yield , on property & casualty 2019s invested assets is an important element of the company 2019s earnings since insurance products are priced with the assumption that premiums received can be invested for a period of time before loss and loss adjustment expenses are paid . for longer tail lines , such as workers 2019 compensation and general liability , claims are paid over several years and , therefore , the premiums received for these lines of business can generate significant investment income . him determines the appropriate allocation of investments by asset class and measures the investment yield performance for each asset class against market indices or other benchmarks . due to the emphasis on preservation of capital and the need to maintain sufficient liquidity to satisfy claim obligations , the vast majority of property and casualty 2019s invested assets have been held in fixed maturities , including , among other asset classes , corporate bonds , municipal bonds , government debt , short-term debt , mortgage- .

Context: 2022 international . in general , our international markets are less advanced with respect to the current technologies deployed for wireless services . as a result , demand for our communications sites is driven by continued voice network investments , new market entrants and initial 3g data network deployments . for example , in india , nationwide voice networks continue to be deployed as wireless service providers are beginning their initial investments in 3g data networks , as a result of recent spectrum auctions . in mexico and brazil , where nationwide voice networks have been deployed , some incumbent wireless service providers continue to invest in their 3g data networks , and recent spectrum auctions have enabled other incumbent wireless service providers and new market entrants to begin their initial investments in 3g data networks . in markets such as chile and peru , recent spectrum auctions have attracted new market entrants , who are expected to begin their investment in deploying nationwide voice and 3g data networks . we believe demand for our tower sites will continue in our international markets as wireless service providers seek to remain competitive by increasing the coverage of their networks while also investing in next generation data networks . rental and management operations new site revenue growth . during the year ended december 31 , 2010 , we grew our portfolio of communications sites through acquisitions and construction activities , including the acquisition and construction of approximately 7800 sites . we continue to evaluate opportunities to acquire larger communications site portfolios , both domestically and internationally , that we believe we can effectively integrate into our existing portfolio. .

( 1 ) the majority of sites acquired or constructed internationally during 2010 and 2009 were in india and our newly launched operations in chile , colombia and peru . network development services segment revenue growth . as we continue to focus on growing our rental and management operations , we anticipate that our network development services revenue will continue to represent a small percentage of our total revenues . through our network development services segment , we offer tower-related services , including site acquisition , zoning and permitting services and structural analysis services , which primarily support our site leasing business and the addition of new tenants and equipment on our sites . rental and management operations expenses . our rental and management operations expenses include our direct site level expenses and consist primarily of ground rent , property taxes , repairs and maintenance and utilities . these segment level expenses exclude all segment and corporate level selling , general , administrative and development expenses , which are aggregated into one line item entitled selling , general , administrative and development expense . in general , our rental and management segment level selling , general and administrative expenses do not significantly increase as a result of adding incremental tenants to our legacy sites and typically increase only modestly year-over-year . as a result , leasing additional space to new tenants on our legacy sites provides significant incremental cash flow . in geographic areas where we have recently launched operations or are focused on materially expanding our site footprint , we may incur additional segment level selling , general and administrative expenses as we increase our presence in these areas . our profit margin growth is therefore positively impacted by the addition of new tenants to our legacy sites and can be temporarily diluted by our development activities . reit election . as we review our tax strategy and assess the utilization of our federal and state nols , we are actively considering an election to a reit for u.s . federal and , where applicable , state income tax purposes . we may make the determination to elect reit status for the taxable year beginning january 1 , 2012 , as early as the second half of 2011 , subject to the approval of our board of directors , although there is no certainty as to the timing of a reit election or whether we will make a reit election at all. .

Context: administrative fees , which increased $ 5.8 million to $ 353.9 million , are generally offset by related operating expenses that are incurred to provide services to the funds and their investors . our largest expense , compensation and related costs , increased $ 18.4 million or 2.3% ( 2.3 % ) from 2007 . this increase includes $ 37.2 million in salaries resulting from an 8.4% ( 8.4 % ) increase in our average staff count and an increase of our associates 2019 base salaries at the beginning of the year . at december 31 , 2008 , we employed 5385 associates , up 6.0% ( 6.0 % ) from the end of 2007 , primarily to add capabilities and support increased volume-related activities and other growth over the past few years . over the course of 2008 , we slowed the growth of our associate base from earlier plans and the prior year . we also reduced our annual bonuses $ 27.6 million versus the 2007 year in response to unfavorable financial market conditions that negatively impacted our operating results . the balance of the increase is attributable to higher employee benefits and employment-related expenses , including an increase of $ 5.7 million in stock-based compensation . after higher spending during the first quarter of 2008 versus 2007 , investor sentiment in the uncertain and volatile market environment caused us to reduce advertising and promotion spending , which for the year was down $ 3.8 million from 2007 . occupancy and facility costs together with depreciation expense increased $ 18 million , or 12% ( 12 % ) compared to 2007 . we expanded and renovated our facilities in 2008 to accommodate the growth in our associates to meet business demands . other operating expenses were up $ 3.3 million from 2007 . we increased our spending $ 9.8 million , primarily for professional fees and information and other third-party services . reductions in travel and charitable contributions partially offset these increases . our non-operating investment activity resulted in a net loss of $ 52.3 million in 2008 as compared to a net gain of $ 80.4 million in 2007 . this change of $ 132.7 million is primarily attributable to losses recognized in 2008 on our investments in sponsored mutual funds , which resulted from declines in financial market values during the year. .

we recognized other than temporary impairments of our investments in sponsored mutual funds because of declines in fair value below cost for an extended period . the significant declines in fair value below cost that occurred in 2008 were generally attributable to adverse market conditions . in addition , income from money market and bond fund holdings was $ 19.3 million lower than in 2007 due to the significantly lower interest rate environment of 2008 . lower interest rates also led to substantial capital appreciation on our $ 40 million holding of u.s . treasury notes that we sold in december 2008 at a $ 2.6 million gain . the 2008 provision for income taxes as a percentage of pretax income is 38.4% ( 38.4 % ) , up from 37.7% ( 37.7 % ) in 2007 , primarily to reflect changes in state income tax rates and regulations and certain adjustments made prospectively based on our annual income tax return filings for 2007 . c a p i t a l r e s o u r c e s a n d l i q u i d i t y . during 2009 , stockholders 2019 equity increased from $ 2.5 billion to $ 2.9 billion . we repurchased nearly 2.3 million common shares for $ 67 million in 2009 . tangible book value is $ 2.2 billion at december 31 , 2009 , and our cash and cash equivalents and our mutual fund investment holdings total $ 1.4 billion . given the availability of these financial resources , we do not maintain an available external source of liquidity . on january 20 , 2010 , we purchased a 26% ( 26 % ) equity interest in uti asset management company and an affiliate for $ 142.4 million . we funded the acquisition from our cash holdings . in addition to the pending uti acquisition , we had outstanding commitments to fund other investments totaling $ 35.4 million at december 31 , 2009 . we presently anticipate funding 2010 property and equipment expenditures of about $ 150 million from our cash balances and operating cash inflows . 22 t . rowe price group annual report 2009 .

||2002|2001|
|de@r at end of period|$ 15.2 million|$ 5.5 million|
|average de@r for the period|$ 10.8 million|$ 6.4 million|
ekt's de@r increased in 2002 compared to 2001 as a result of an increase in the size of the position held and an increase in the volatility of natural gas prices in the latter part of the year . for all derivative and contractual transactions , ekt is exposed to losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to these transactions . relevant considerations when assessing ekt's credit risk exposure include: .

in fiscal 2018 , we continued to pursue our strategy of offering differentiated paper and packaging solutions that help our customers win . we successfully executed this strategy in fiscal 2018 in a rapidly changing cost and price environment . net sales of $ 16285.1 million for fiscal 2018 increased $ 1425.4 million , or 9.6% ( 9.6 % ) , compared to fiscal 2017 . the increase was primarily a result of an increase in corrugated packaging segment sales , driven by higher selling price/mix and the contributions from acquisitions , and increased consumer packaging segment sales , primarily due to the contribution from acquisitions ( primarily the mps acquisition ) . these increases were partially offset by the absence of net sales from hh&b in fiscal 2018 due to the sale of hh&b in april 2017 and lower land and development segment sales compared to the prior year period due to the timing of real estate sales as we monetize the portfolio and lower merchandising display sales in the consumer packaging segment . segment income increased $ 491.5 million in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 , primarily due to increased corrugated packaging segment income . with respect to segment income , we experienced higher levels of cost inflation during fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017 , which was partially offset by recycled fiber deflation . the primary inflationary items were freight costs , chemical costs , virgin fiber costs and wage and other costs . productivity improvements in fiscal 2018 more than offset the net impact of cost inflation . while it is difficult to predict specific inflationary items , we expect higher cost inflation to continue through fiscal 2019 . our corrugated packaging segment increased its net sales by $ 695.1 million in fiscal 2018 to $ 9103.4 million from $ 8408.3 million in fiscal 2017 . the increase in net sales was primarily due to higher corrugated selling price/mix and higher corrugated volumes ( including acquisitions ) , which were partially offset by lower net sales from recycling operations due to lower recycled fiber costs , lower sales related to the deconsolidation of a foreign joint venture in fiscal 2017 and the impact of foreign currency . north american box shipments increased 4.1% ( 4.1 % ) on a per day basis in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 . segment income attributable to the corrugated packaging segment in fiscal 2018 increased $ 454.0 million to $ 1207.9 million compared to $ 753.9 million in fiscal 2017 . the increase was primarily due to higher selling price/mix , lower recycled fiber costs and productivity improvements which were partially offset by higher levels of cost inflation and other items , including increased depreciation and amortization . our consumer packaging segment increased its net sales by $ 838.9 million in fiscal 2018 to $ 7291.4 million from $ 6452.5 million in fiscal 2017 . the increase in net sales was primarily due to an increase in net sales from acquisitions ( primarily the mps acquisition ) and higher selling price/mix partially offset by the absence of net sales from hh&b in fiscal 2018 due to the hh&b sale in april 2017 and lower volumes . segment income attributable to .

the black-scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options which have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable . in addition , option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions , including the expected stock price volatility . because the company 2019s employee stock options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options , and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate , in management 2019s opinion , the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of its employee stock options . the fair value of the rsus was determined based on the market value at the date of grant . the total fair value of awards vested during 2008 , 2007 , and 2006 was $ 35384 , $ 17840 , and $ 9413 , respectively . the total stock based compensation expense calculated using the black-scholes option valuation model in 2008 , 2007 , and 2006 was $ 38872 , $ 22164 , and $ 11913 , respectively.the aggregate intrinsic values of options outstanding and exercisable at december 27 , 2008 were $ 8.2 million and $ 8.2 million , respectively . the aggregate intrinsic value of options exercised during the year ended december 27 , 2008 was $ 0.6 million . aggregate intrinsic value represents the positive difference between the company 2019s closing stock price on the last trading day of the fiscal period , which was $ 19.39 on december 27 , 2008 , and the exercise price multiplied by the number of options exercised . as of december 27 , 2008 , there was $ 141.7 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested share-based compensation awards granted to employees under the stock compensation plans . that cost is expected to be recognized over a period of five years . employee stock purchase plan the shareholders also adopted an employee stock purchase plan ( espp ) . up to 2000000 shares of common stock have been reserved for the espp . shares will be offered to employees at a price equal to the lesser of 85% ( 85 % ) of the fair market value of the stock on the date of purchase or 85% ( 85 % ) of the fair market value on the enrollment date . the espp is intended to qualify as an 201cemployee stock purchase plan 201d under section 423 of the internal revenue code . during 2008 , 2007 , and 2006 , 362902 , 120230 , and 124693 shares , respectively were purchased under the plan for a total purchase price of $ 8782 , $ 5730 , and $ 3569 , respectively . at december 27 , 2008 , approximately 663679 shares were available for future issuance . 10 . earnings per share the following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted net income per share: .

|dividend yields|0.19% ( 0.19 % )|0.34% ( 0.34 % )|
|expected lives|3 months|3 months|
the risk-free interest rate is based on the yield of a zero coupon united states treasury security with a maturity equal to the expected life of the option from the date of the grant . our assumption on expected volatility is based on our historical volatility . the dividend yield assumption is calculated using our average stock price over the preceding year and the annualized amount of our current quarterly dividend . since the purchase price for shares under the plan is based on the market value on the first day or last day of the quarterly purchase period , we use an expected life of three months to determine the fair value of each designated share. .

Context: provision for income taxes increased $ 1791 million in 2012 from 2011 primarily due to the increase in pretax income from continuing operations , including the impact of the resumption of sales in libya in the first quarter of 2012 . the following is an analysis of the effective income tax rates for 2012 and 2011: .
||2012|2011|
|statutory rate applied to income from continuing operations before income taxes|35% ( 35 % )|35% ( 35 % )|

|adjustments to valuation allowances|21|14|
|tax law changes|2014|1|
|effective income tax rate on continuing operations|74% ( 74 % )|61% ( 61 % )|
the effective income tax rate is influenced by a variety of factors including the geographic sources of income and the relative magnitude of these sources of income . the provision for income taxes is allocated on a discrete , stand-alone basis to pretax segment income and to individual items not allocated to segments . the difference between the total provision and the sum of the amounts allocated to segments appears in the ""corporate and other unallocated items"" shown in the reconciliation of segment income to net income below . effects of foreign operations 2013 the effects of foreign operations on our effective tax rate increased in 2012 as compared to 2011 , primarily due to the resumption of sales in libya in the first quarter of 2012 , where the statutory rate is in excess of 90 percent . change in permanent reinvestment assertion 2013 in the second quarter of 2011 , we recorded $ 716 million of deferred u.s . tax on undistributed earnings of $ 2046 million that we previously intended to permanently reinvest in foreign operations . offsetting this tax expense were associated foreign tax credits of $ 488 million . in addition , we reduced our valuation allowance related to foreign tax credits by $ 228 million due to recognizing deferred u.s . tax on previously undistributed earnings . adjustments to valuation allowances 2013 in 2012 and 2011 , we increased the valuation allowance against foreign tax credits because it is more likely than not that we will be unable to realize all u.s . benefits on foreign taxes accrued in those years . see item 8 . financial statements and supplementary data - note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about income taxes . discontinued operations is presented net of tax , and reflects our downstream business that was spun off june 30 , 2011 and our angola business which we agreed to sell in 2013 . see item 8 . financial statements and supplementary data 2013 notes 3 and 6 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. .

|proceeds from sales of property and equipment|-15 ( 15 )|
|property and equipment received net of proceeds during 2017|$ 975|
results of operations revenue we generate revenue primarily from our solid waste collection operations . our remaining revenue is from other services , including transfer station , landfill disposal , recycling , and energy services . our residential and small- container commercial collection operations in some markets are based on long-term contracts with municipalities . certain of our municipal contracts have annual price escalation clauses that are tied to changes in an underlying base index such as a consumer price index . we generally provide small-container commercial and large-container industrial collection services to customers under contracts with terms up to three years . our transfer stations , landfills and , to a lesser extent , our recycling facilities generate revenue from disposal or tipping fees charged to third parties . in general , we integrate our recycling operations with our collection operations and obtain revenue from the sale of recycled commodities . our revenue from energy services consists mainly of fees we charge for the treatment of liquid and solid waste derived from the production of oil and natural gas . other revenue consists primarily of revenue from national accounts , which represents the portion of revenue generated from nationwide or regional contracts in markets outside our operating areas where the associated waste handling services are subcontracted to local operators . consequently , substantially all of this revenue is offset with related subcontract costs , which are recorded in cost of operations. .

Context: 31 , 2015 , the price was r$ 218/mwh . after the expiration of contract with eletropaulo , tiet ea's strategy is to contract most of its physical guarantee , as described in regulatory framework section below , and sell the remaining portion in the spot market . tiet ea's strategy is reassessed from time to time according to changes in market conditions , hydrology and other factors . tiet ea has been continuously selling its available energy from 2016 forward through medium-term bilateral contracts of three to five years . as of december 31 , 2016 , tiet ea's contracted portfolio position is 95% ( 95 % ) and 88% ( 88 % ) with average prices of r$ 157/ mwh and r$ 159/mwh ( inflation adjusted until december 2016 ) for 2016 and 2017 , respectively . as brazil is mostly a hydro-based country with energy prices highly tied to the hydrological situation , the deterioration of the hydrology since the beginning of 2014 caused an increase in energy prices going forward . tiet ea is closely monitoring and analyzing system supply conditions to support energy commercialization decisions . under the concession agreement , tiet ea has an obligation to increase its capacity by 15% ( 15 % ) . tiet ea , as well as other concession generators , have not yet met this requirement due to regulatory , environmental , hydrological and fuel constraints . the state of s e3o paulo does not have a sufficient potential for wind power and only has a small remaining potential for hydro projects . as such , the capacity increases in the state will mostly be derived from thermal gas capacity projects . due to the highly complex process to obtain an environmental license for coal projects , tiet ea decided to fulfill its obligation with gas-fired projects in line with the federal government plans . petrobras refuses to supply natural gas and to offer capacity in its pipelines and regasification terminals . therefore , there are no regulations for natural gas swaps in place , and it is unfeasible to bring natural gas to aes tiet ea . a legal case has been initiated by the state of s e3o paulo requiring the investment to be performed . tiet ea is in the process of analyzing options to meet the obligation . uruguaiana is a 640 mw gas-fired combined cycle power plant located in the town of uruguaiana in the state of rio grande do sul , commissioned in december 2000 . aes manages and has a 46% ( 46 % ) economic interest in the plant with the remaining interest held by bndes . the plant's operations were suspended in april 2009 due to the unavailability of gas . aes has evaluated several alternatives to bring gas supply on a competitive basis to uruguaiana . one of the challenges is the capacity restrictions on the argentinean pipeline , especially during the winter season when gas demand in argentina is very high . the plant operated on a short-term basis during february and march 2013 , march through may 2014 , and february through may 2015 due to the short-term supply of lng for the facility . the plant did not operate in 2016 . uruguaiana continues to work toward securing gas on a long-term basis . market structure 2014 brazil has installed capacity of 150136 mw , which is 65% ( 65 % ) hydroelectric , 19% ( 19 % ) thermal and 16% ( 16 % ) renewable ( biomass and wind ) . brazil's national grid is divided into four subsystems . tiet ea is in the southeast and uruguaiana is in the south subsystems of the national grid . regulatory framework 2014 in brazil , the ministry of mines and energy determines the maximum amount of energy that a plant can sell , called physical guarantee , which represents the long-term average expected energy production of the plant . under current rules , physical guarantee can be sold to distribution companies through long- term regulated auctions or under unregulated bilateral contracts with large consumers or energy trading companies . the national system operator ( ""ons"" ) is responsible for coordinating and controlling the operation of the national grid . the ons dispatches generators based on hydrological conditions , reservoir levels , electricity demand and the prices of fuel and thermal generation . given the importance of hydro generation in the country , the ons sometimes reduces dispatch of hydro facilities and increases dispatch of thermal facilities to protect reservoir levels in the system . in brazil , the system operator controls all hydroelectric generation dispatch and reservoir levels . a mechanism known as the energy reallocation mechanism ( ""mre"" ) was created to share hydrological risk across mre hydro generators . if the hydro plants generate less than the total mre physical guarantee , the hydro generators may need to purchase energy in the short-term market to fulfill their contract obligations . when total hydro generation is higher than the total mre physical guarantee , the surplus is proportionally shared among its participants and they are able to make extra revenue selling the excess energy on the spot market . the consequences of unfavorable hydrology are ( i ) thermal plants more expensive to the system being dispatched , ( ii ) lower hydropower generation with deficits in the mre and ( iii ) high spot prices . aneel defines the spot price cap for electricity in the brazilian market . the spot price caps as defined by aneel and average spot prices by calendar year are as follows ( r$ / .

Context: 29 annual report 2012 duke realty corporation | | those indirect costs not allocated to or absorbed by these operations are charged to general and administrative expenses . we regularly review our total overhead cost structure relative to our leasing , development and construction volume and adjust the level of total overhead , generally through changes in our level of staffing in various functional departments , as necessary in order to control overall general and administrative expense . general and administrative expenses increased from $ 43.1 million in 2011 to $ 46.4 million in 2012 . the following table sets forth the factors that led to the increase in general and administrative expenses from 2011 to 2012 ( in millions ) : .
|general and administrative expenses - 2011|$ 43.1|
|reduction to overall pool of overhead costs ( 1 )|-11.0 ( 11.0 )|
|increased absorption of costs by wholly-owned development and leasing activities ( 2 )|-14.7 ( 14.7 )|
|reduced allocation of costs to service operations and rental operations ( 3 )|29.0|
|general and administrative expenses - 2012|$ 46.4|
( 1 ) we reduced our total pool of overhead costs , through staff reductions and other measures , as the result of changes in our product mix and anticipated future levels of third-party construction , leasing , management and other operational activities . ( 2 ) we increased our focus on development of wholly-owned properties , and also significantly increased our leasing activity during 2012 , which resulted in an increased absorption of overhead costs . we capitalized $ 30.4 million and $ 20.0 million of our total overhead costs to leasing and development , respectively , for consolidated properties during 2012 , compared to capitalizing $ 25.3 million and $ 10.4 million of such costs , respectively , for 2011 . combined overhead costs capitalized to leasing and development totaled 31.1% ( 31.1 % ) and 20.6% ( 20.6 % ) of our overall pool of overhead costs for 2012 and 2011 , respectively . ( 3 ) the reduction in the allocation of overhead costs to service operations and rental operations resulted from reduced volumes of third-party construction projects as well as due to reducing our overall investment in office properties , which are more management intensive . interest expense interest expense allocable to continuing operations increased from $ 220.5 million in 2011 to $ 245.2 million in 2012 . we had $ 47.4 million of interest expense allocated to discontinued operations in 2011 , associated with the properties that were disposed of during 2011 , compared to the allocation of only $ 3.1 million of interest expense to discontinued operations for 2012 . total interest expense , combined for continuing and discontinued operations , decreased from $ 267.8 million in 2011 to $ 248.3 million in 2012 . the reduction in total interest expense was primarily the result of a lower weighted average borrowing rate in 2012 , due to refinancing some higher rate bonds in 2011 and 2012 , as well as a slight decrease in our average level of borrowings compared to 2011 . also , due to an increase in properties under development from 2011 , which met the criteria for capitalization of interest and were financed in part by common equity issuances during 2012 , a $ 5.0 million increase in capitalized interest also contributed to the decrease in total interest expense in 2012 . acquisition-related activity during 2012 , we recognized approximately $ 4.2 million in acquisition costs , compared to $ 2.3 million of such costs in 2011 . the increase from 2011 to 2012 is the result of acquiring a higher volume of medical office properties , where a higher level of acquisition costs are incurred than other property types , in 2012 . during 2011 , we also recognized a $ 1.1 million gain related to the acquisition of a building from one of our 50%-owned unconsolidated joint ventures . discontinued operations subject to certain criteria , the results of operations for properties sold during the year to unrelated parties , or classified as held-for-sale at the end of the period , are required to be classified as discontinued operations . the property specific components of earnings that are classified as discontinued operations include rental revenues , rental expenses , real estate taxes , allocated interest expense and depreciation expense , as well as the net gain or loss on the disposition of properties . the operations of 150 buildings are currently classified as discontinued operations . these 150 buildings consist of 114 office , 30 industrial , four retail , and two medical office properties . as a result , we classified operating losses , before gain on sales , of $ 1.5 million , $ 1.8 million and $ 7.1 million in discontinued operations for the years ended december 31 , 2012 , 2011 and 2010 , respectively . of these properties , 28 were sold during 2012 , 101 properties were sold during 2011 and 19 properties were sold during 2010 . the gains on disposal of these properties of $ 13.5 million , $ 100.9 million and $ 33.1 million for the years ended december 31 , 2012 , 2011 and .

|forfeited|-226 ( 226 )|81.74|
|nonvested at december 31 2013|3859|$ 82.42|
rsus are valued based on the fair value of our common stock on the date of grant . employees who are granted rsus receive the right to receive shares of stock after completion of the vesting period , however , the shares are not issued , and the employees cannot sell or transfer shares prior to vesting and have no voting rights until the rsus vest , generally three years from the date of the award . employees who are granted rsus receive dividend-equivalent cash payments only upon vesting . for these rsu awards , the grant-date fair value is equal to the closing market price of our common stock on the date of grant less a discount to reflect the delay in payment of dividend-equivalent cash payments . we recognize the grant-date fair value of rsus , less estimated forfeitures , as compensation expense ratably over the requisite service period , which beginning with the rsus granted in 2013 is shorter than the vesting period if the employee is retirement eligible on the date of grant or will become retirement eligible before the end of the vesting period . stock options we generally recognize compensation cost for stock options ratably over the three-year vesting period . at december 31 , 2013 and 2012 , there were 10.2 million ( weighted average exercise price of $ 83.65 ) and 20.6 million ( weighted average exercise price of $ 83.15 ) stock options outstanding . stock options outstanding at december 31 , 2013 have a weighted average remaining contractual life of approximately five years and an aggregate intrinsic value of $ 663 million , and we expect nearly all of these stock options to vest . of the stock options outstanding , 7.7 million ( weighted average exercise price of $ 84.37 ) have vested as of december 31 , 2013 and those stock options have a weighted average remaining contractual life of approximately four years and an aggregate intrinsic value of $ 497 million . there were 10.1 million ( weighted average exercise price of $ 82.72 ) stock options exercised during 2013 . we did not grant stock options to employees during 2013. .

with 2011 . average sales price was lower mainly due to export containerboard sales prices which bottomed out in the first quarter but climbed steadily the rest of the year . input costs were lower for recycled fiber , wood and natural gas , but higher for starch . freight costs also increased . plan- ned maintenance downtime costs were higher than in 2011 . operating costs were higher largely due to routine inventory valuation adjustments operating profits in 2012 benefited from $ 235 million of temple-inland synergies . market-related downtime in 2012 was about 570000 tons compared with

depreciation 2013 the railroad industry is capital intensive . properties are carried at cost . provisions for depreciation are computed principally on the straight-line method based on estimated service lives of depreciable property . the lives are calculated using a separate composite annual percentage rate for each depreciable property group , based on the results of internal depreciation studies . we are required to submit a report on depreciation studies and proposed depreciation rates to the stb for review and approval every three years for equipment property and every six years for road property . the cost ( net of salvage ) of depreciable railroad property retired or replaced in the ordinary course of business is charged to accumulated depreciation , and no gain or loss is recognized . a gain or loss is recognized in other income for all other property upon disposition because the gain or loss is not part of rail operations . the cost of internally developed software is capitalized and amortized over a five-year period . significant capital spending in recent years increased the total value of our depreciable assets . cash capital spending totaled $ 2.2 billion for the year ended december 31 , 2006 . for the year ended december 31 , 2006 , depreciation expense was $ 1.2 billion . we use various methods to estimate useful lives for each group of depreciable property . due to the capital intensive nature of the business and the large base of depreciable assets , variances to those estimates could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements . if the estimated useful lives of all depreciable assets were increased by one year , annual depreciation expense would decrease by approximately $ 43 million . if the estimated useful lives of all assets to be depreciated were decreased by one year , annual depreciation expense would increase by approximately $ 45 million . income taxes 2013 as required under fasb statement no . 109 , accounting for income taxes , we account for income taxes by recording taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns . these .

operating environment . during 2017 , investment management operated in an environment characterized by generally higher asset prices , resulting in appreciation in both equity and fixed income assets . in addition , our long- term assets under supervision increased from net inflows primarily in fixed income and alternative investment assets . these increases were partially offset by net outflows in liquidity products . as a result , the mix of average assets under supervision during 2017 shifted slightly from liquidity products to long-term assets under supervision as compared to the mix at the end of 2016 . in the future , if asset prices decline , or investors favor assets that typically generate lower fees or investors withdraw their assets , net revenues in investment management would likely be negatively impacted . following a challenging first quarter of 2016 , market conditions improved during the remainder of 2016 with higher asset prices resulting in full year appreciation in both equity and fixed income assets . also , our assets under supervision increased during 2016 from net inflows , primarily in fixed income assets , and liquidity products . the mix of our average assets under supervision shifted slightly compared with 2015 from long-term assets under supervision to liquidity products . management fees were impacted by many factors , including inflows to advisory services and outflows from actively-managed mutual funds . 2017 versus 2016 . net revenues in investment management were $ 6.22 billion for 2017 , 7% ( 7 % ) higher than 2016 , due to higher management and other fees , reflecting higher average assets under supervision , and higher transaction revenues . during the year , total assets under supervision increased $ 115 billion to $ 1.49 trillion . long- term assets under supervision increased $ 128 billion , including net market appreciation of $ 86 billion , primarily in equity and fixed income assets , and net inflows of $ 42 billion ( which includes $ 20 billion of inflows in connection with the verus acquisition and $ 5 billion of equity asset outflows in connection with the australian divestiture ) , primarily in fixed income and alternative investment assets . liquidity products decreased $ 13 billion ( which includes $ 3 billion of inflows in connection with the verus acquisition ) . operating expenses were $ 4.80 billion for 2017 , 3% ( 3 % ) higher than 2016 , primarily due to increased compensation and benefits expenses , reflecting higher net revenues . pre-tax earnings were $ 1.42 billion in 2017 , 25% ( 25 % ) higher than 2016 versus 2015 . net revenues in investment management were $ 5.79 billion for 2016 , 7% ( 7 % ) lower than 2015 . this decrease primarily reflected significantly lower incentive fees compared with a strong 2015 . in addition , management and other fees were slightly lower , reflecting shifts in the mix of client assets and strategies , partially offset by the impact of higher average assets under supervision . during 2016 , total assets under supervision increased $ 127 billion to $ 1.38 trillion . long-term assets under supervision increased $ 75 billion , including net inflows of $ 42 billion , primarily in fixed income assets , and net market appreciation of $ 33 billion , primarily in equity and fixed income assets . in addition , liquidity products increased $ 52 billion . operating expenses were $ 4.65 billion for 2016 , 4% ( 4 % ) lower than 2015 , due to decreased compensation and benefits expenses , reflecting lower net revenues . pre-tax earnings were $ 1.13 billion in 2016 , 17% ( 17 % ) lower than 2015 . geographic data see note 25 to the consolidated financial statements for a summary of our total net revenues , pre-tax earnings and net earnings by geographic region . goldman sachs 2017 form 10-k 63 .

Context: part ii on november 1 , 2011 , we entered into a committed credit facility agreement with a syndicate of banks which provides for up to $ 1 billion of borrowings with the option to increase borrowings to $ 1.5 billion with lender approval . following an extension agreement on september 17 , 2013 between the company and the syndicate of banks , the facility matures november 1 , 2017 , with a one-year extension option exercisable through october 31 , 2014 . no amounts were outstanding under this facility as of may 31 , 2014 or 2013 . we currently have long-term debt ratings of aa- and a1 from standard and poor 2019s corporation and moody 2019s investor services , respectively . if our long- term debt rating were to decline , the facility fee and interest rate under our committed credit facility would increase . conversely , if our long-term debt rating were to improve , the facility fee and interest rate would decrease . changes in our long-term debt rating would not trigger acceleration of maturity of any then-outstanding borrowings or any future borrowings under the committed credit facility . under this committed revolving credit facility , we have agreed to various covenants . these covenants include limits on our disposal of fixed assets , the amount of debt secured by liens we may incur , as well as a minimum capitalization ratio . in the event we were to have any borrowings outstanding under this facility and failed to meet any covenant , and were unable to obtain a waiver from a majority of the banks in the syndicate , any borrowings would become immediately due and payable . as of may 31 , 2014 , we were in full compliance with each of these covenants and believe it is unlikely we will fail to meet any of these covenants in the foreseeable future . liquidity is also provided by our $ 1 billion commercial paper program . during the year ended may 31 , 2014 , we did not issue commercial paper , and as of may 31 , 2014 , there were no outstanding borrowings under this program . we may continue to issue commercial paper or other debt securities during fiscal 2015 depending on general corporate needs . we currently have short-term debt ratings of a1+ and p1 from standard and poor 2019s corporation and moody 2019s investor services , respectively . as of may 31 , 2014 , we had cash , cash equivalents , and short-term investments totaling $ 5.1 billion , of which $ 2.5 billion was held by our foreign subsidiaries . cash equivalents and short-term investments consist primarily of deposits held at major banks , money market funds , commercial paper , corporate notes , u.s . treasury obligations , u.s . government sponsored enterprise obligations , and other investment grade fixed income securities . our fixed income investments are exposed to both credit and interest rate risk . all of our investments are investment grade to minimize our credit risk . while individual securities have varying durations , as of may 31 , 2014 the average duration of our short-term investments and cash equivalents portfolio was 126 days . to date we have not experienced difficulty accessing the credit markets or incurred higher interest costs . future volatility in the capital markets , however , may increase costs associated with issuing commercial paper or other debt instruments or affect our ability to access those markets . we believe that existing cash , cash equivalents , short-term investments , and cash generated by operations , together with access to external sources of funds as described above , will be sufficient to meet our domestic and foreign capital needs in the foreseeable future . we utilize a variety of tax planning and financing strategies to manage our worldwide cash and deploy funds to locations where they are needed . we routinely repatriate a portion of our foreign earnings for which u.s . taxes have previously been provided . we also indefinitely reinvest a significant portion of our foreign earnings , and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate these earnings . should we require additional capital in the united states , we may elect to repatriate indefinitely reinvested foreign funds or raise capital in the united states through debt . if we were to repatriate indefinitely reinvested foreign funds , we would be required to accrue and pay additional u.s . taxes less applicable foreign tax credits . if we elect to raise capital in the united states through debt , we would incur additional interest expense . off-balance sheet arrangements in connection with various contracts and agreements , we routinely provide indemnification relating to the enforceability of intellectual property rights , coverage for legal issues that arise and other items where we are acting as the guarantor . currently , we have several such agreements in place . however , based on our historical experience and the estimated probability of future loss , we have determined that the fair value of such indemnification is not material to our financial position or results of operations . contractual obligations our significant long-term contractual

our losses from future catastrophic events could exceed our projections . we use projections of possible losses from future catastrophic events of varying types and magnitudes as a strategic underwriting tool . we use these loss projections to estimate our potential catastrophe losses in certain geographic areas and decide on the placement of retrocessional coverage or other actions to limit the extent of potential losses in a given geographic area . these loss projections are approximations , reliant on a mix of quantitative and qualitative processes , and actual losses may exceed the projections by a material amount , resulting in a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. .

as of december 29 , 2007 the entire amount of unrecognized tax benefits , if recognized , would reduce the company 2019s annual effective tax rate . with the adoption of fin 48 , the company provides for interest and penalties as a part of income tax expense . during fiscal 2007 , the company accrued potential penalties and interest of $ 709 and $ 1827 , respectively , related to these unrecognized tax benefits . as of december 29 , 2007 , the company has recorded a liability for potential penalties and interest of $ 1843 and $ 4421 , respectively . prior to the adoption of fin 48 , the company classified interest associated with tax contingencies in interest expense . the company has not provided for any penalties associated with tax contingencies unless considered probable of assessment . the company does not expect its unrecognized tax benefits to change significantly over the next 12 months . during the next 12 months , it is possible the company could conclude on $ 2000 to $ 3000 of the contingencies associated with unrecognized tax uncertainties due mainly to settlements and expiration of statute of limitations ( including tax benefits , interest and penalties ) . the majority of these resolutions would be achieved through the completion of current income tax examinations. .

Context: management 2019s discussion and analysis net revenues in equities were $ 8.21 billion for 2012 , essentially unchanged compared with 2011 . net revenues in securities services were significantly higher compared with 2011 , reflecting a gain of $ 494 million on the sale of our hedge fund administration business . in addition , equities client execution net revenues were higher than 2011 , primarily reflecting significantly higher results in cash products , principally due to increased levels of client activity . these increases were offset by lower commissions and fees , reflecting declines in the united states , europe and asia . our average daily volumes during 2012 were lower in each of these regions compared with 2011 , consistent with listed cash equity market volumes . during 2012 , equities operated in an environment generally characterized by an increase in global equity prices and lower volatility levels . the net loss attributable to the impact of changes in our own credit spreads on borrowings for which the fair value option was elected was $ 714 million ( $ 433 million and $ 281 million related to fixed income , currency and commodities client execution and equities client execution , respectively ) for 2012 , compared with a net gain of $ 596 million ( $ 399 million and $ 197 million related to fixed income , currency and commodities client execution and equities client execution , respectively ) for 2011 . during 2012 , institutional client services operated in an environment generally characterized by continued broad market concerns and uncertainties , although positive developments helped to improve market conditions . these developments included certain central bank actions to ease monetary policy and address funding risks for european financial institutions . in addition , the u.s . economy posted stable to improving economic data , including favorable developments in unemployment and housing . these improvements resulted in tighter credit spreads , higher global equity prices and lower levels of volatility . however , concerns about the outlook for the global economy and continued political uncertainty , particularly the political debate in the united states surrounding the fiscal cliff , generally resulted in client risk aversion and lower activity levels . also , uncertainty over financial regulatory reform persisted . operating expenses were $ 12.48 billion for 2012 , 3% ( 3 % ) lower than 2011 , primarily due to lower brokerage , clearing , exchange and distribution fees , and lower impairment charges , partially offset by higher net provisions for litigation and regulatory proceedings . pre- tax earnings were $ 5.64 billion in 2012 , 27% ( 27 % ) higher than 2011 . investing & lending investing & lending includes our investing activities and the origination of loans to provide financing to clients . these investments , some of which are consolidated , and loans are typically longer-term in nature . we make investments , directly and indirectly through funds that we manage , in debt securities and loans , public and private equity securities , and real estate entities . the table below presents the operating results of our investing & lending segment. .

2013 versus 2012 . net revenues in investing & lending were $ 7.02 billion for 2013 , 19% ( 19 % ) higher than 2012 , reflecting a significant increase in net gains from investments in equity securities , driven by company-specific events and stronger corporate performance , as well as significantly higher global equity prices . in addition , net gains and net interest income from debt securities and loans were slightly higher , while other net revenues , related to our consolidated investments , were lower compared with 2012 . if equity markets decline or credit spreads widen , net revenues in investing & lending would likely be negatively impacted . operating expenses were $ 2.68 billion for 2013 , essentially unchanged compared with 2012 . operating expenses during 2013 included lower impairment charges and lower operating expenses related to consolidated investments , partially offset by increased compensation and benefits expenses due to higher net revenues compared with 2012 . pre-tax earnings were $ 4.33 billion in 2013 , 34% ( 34 % ) higher than 2012 . 52 goldman sachs 2013 annual report .

Context: liquidity and capital resources as of december 31 , 2011 , our principal sources of liquidity included cash , cash equivalents , our receivables securitization facility , and our revolving credit facility , as well as the availability of commercial paper and other sources of financing through the capital markets . we had $ 1.8 billion of committed credit available under our credit facility , with no borrowings outstanding as of december 31 , 2011 . we did not make any borrowings under this facility during 2011 . the value of the outstanding undivided interest held by investors under the receivables securitization facility was $ 100 million as of december 31 , 2011 , and is included in our consolidated statements of financial position as debt due after one year . the receivables securitization facility obligates us to maintain an investment grade bond rating . if our bond rating were to deteriorate , it could have an adverse impact on our liquidity . access to commercial paper as well as other capital market financings is dependent on market conditions . deterioration of our operating results or financial condition due to internal or external factors could negatively impact our ability to access capital markets as a source of liquidity . access to liquidity through the capital markets is also dependent on our financial stability . we expect that we will continue to have access to liquidity by issuing bonds to public or private investors based on our assessment of the current condition of the credit markets . at december 31 , 2011 and 2010 , we had a working capital surplus . this reflects a strong cash position , which provides enhanced liquidity in an uncertain economic environment . in addition , we believe we have adequate access to capital markets to meet cash requirements , and we have sufficient financial capacity to satisfy our current liabilities . cash flows millions 2011 2010 2009 .

operating activities higher net income and lower cash income tax payments in 2011 increased cash provided by operating activities compared to 2010 . the tax relief , unemployment insurance reauthorization , and job creation act of 2010 , enacted in december 2010 , provided for 100% ( 100 % ) bonus depreciation for qualified investments made during 2011 , and 50% ( 50 % ) bonus depreciation for qualified investments made during 2012 . as a result of the act , the company deferred a substantial portion of its 2011 income tax expense . this deferral decreased 2011 income tax payments , thereby contributing to the positive operating cash flow . in future years , however , additional cash will be used to pay income taxes that were previously deferred . in addition , the adoption of a new accounting standard in january of 2010 changed the accounting treatment for our receivables securitization facility from a sale of undivided interests ( recorded as an operating activity ) to a secured borrowing ( recorded as a financing activity ) , which decreased cash provided by operating activities by $ 400 million in 2010 . higher net income in 2010 increased cash provided by operating activities compared to 2009 . investing activities higher capital investments partially offset by higher proceeds from asset sales in 2011 drove the increase in cash used in investing activities compared to 2010 . higher capital investments and lower proceeds from asset sales in 2010 drove the increase in cash used in investing activities compared to 2009. .

Context: administrative fees , which increased $ 5.8 million to $ 353.9 million , are generally offset by related operating expenses that are incurred to provide services to the funds and their investors . our largest expense , compensation and related costs , increased $ 18.4 million or 2.3% ( 2.3 % ) from 2007 . this increase includes $ 37.2 million in salaries resulting from an 8.4% ( 8.4 % ) increase in our average staff count and an increase of our associates 2019 base salaries at the beginning of the year . at december 31 , 2008 , we employed 5385 associates , up 6.0% ( 6.0 % ) from the end of 2007 , primarily to add capabilities and support increased volume-related activities and other growth over the past few years . over the course of 2008 , we slowed the growth of our associate base from earlier plans and the prior year . we also reduced our annual bonuses $ 27.6 million versus the 2007 year in response to unfavorable financial market conditions that negatively impacted our operating results . the balance of the increase is attributable to higher employee benefits and employment-related expenses , including an increase of $ 5.7 million in stock-based compensation . after higher spending during the first quarter of 2008 versus 2007 , investor sentiment in the uncertain and volatile market environment caused us to reduce advertising and promotion spending , which for the year was down $ 3.8 million from 2007 . occupancy and facility costs together with depreciation expense increased $ 18 million , or 12% ( 12 % ) compared to 2007 . we expanded and renovated our facilities in 2008 to accommodate the growth in our associates to meet business demands . other operating expenses were up $ 3.3 million from 2007 . we increased our spending $ 9.8 million , primarily for professional fees and information and other third-party services . reductions in travel and charitable contributions partially offset these increases . our non-operating investment activity resulted in a net loss of $ 52.3 million in 2008 as compared to a net gain of $ 80.4 million in 2007 . this change of $ 132.7 million is primarily attributable to losses recognized in 2008 on our investments in sponsored mutual funds , which resulted from declines in financial market values during the year. .

we recognized other than temporary impairments of our investments in sponsored mutual funds because of declines in fair value below cost for an extended period . the significant declines in fair value below cost that occurred in 2008 were generally attributable to adverse market conditions . in addition , income from money market and bond fund holdings was $ 19.3 million lower than in 2007 due to the significantly lower interest rate environment of 2008 . lower interest rates also led to substantial capital appreciation on our $ 40 million holding of u.s . treasury notes that we sold in december 2008 at a $ 2.6 million gain . the 2008 provision for income taxes as a percentage of pretax income is 38.4% ( 38.4 % ) , up from 37.7% ( 37.7 % ) in 2007 , primarily to reflect changes in state income tax rates and regulations and certain adjustments made prospectively based on our annual income tax return filings for 2007 . c a p i t a l r e s o u r c e s a n d l i q u i d i t y . during 2009 , stockholders 2019 equity increased from $ 2.5 billion to $ 2.9 billion . we repurchased nearly 2.3 million common shares for $ 67 million in 2009 . tangible book value is $ 2.2 billion at december 31 , 2009 , and our cash and cash equivalents and our mutual fund investment holdings total $ 1.4 billion . given the availability of these financial resources , we do not maintain an available external source of liquidity . on january 20 , 2010 , we purchased a 26% ( 26 % ) equity interest in uti asset management company and an affiliate for $ 142.4 million . we funded the acquisition from our cash holdings . in addition to the pending uti acquisition , we had outstanding commitments to fund other investments totaling $ 35.4 million at december 31 , 2009 . we presently anticipate funding 2010 property and equipment expenditures of about $ 150 million from our cash balances and operating cash inflows . 22 t . rowe price group annual report 2009 .

the volume/weather variance is primarily due to a decrease of 97 gwh in weather-adjusted usage in the residential and commercial sectors and a decrease in sales volume in the unbilled sales period . the transmission equalization variance is primarily due to the addition in 2011 of transmission investments that are subject to equalization . gross operating revenues and fuel and purchased power expenses gross operating revenues increased primarily due to an increase of $ 57.5 million in gross wholesale revenues due to an increase in sales to affiliated customers , partially offset by a decrease of $ 26.9 million in power management rider revenue . fuel and purchased power expenses increased primarily due to an increase in deferred fuel expense as a result of higher fuel revenues due to higher fuel rates , partially offset by a decrease in the average market prices of natural gas and purchased power. .

Context: the discount rate used to measure pension obligations is determined by comparing the expected future benefits that will be paid under the plan with yields available on high quality corporate bonds of similar duration . the impact on pension expense of a .5% ( .5 % ) decrease in discount rate in the current environment is an increase of $ 18 million per year . this sensitivity depends on the economic environment and amount of unrecognized actuarial gains or losses on the measurement date . the expected long-term return on assets assumption also has a significant effect on pension expense . the expected return on plan assets is a long-term assumption established by considering historical and anticipated returns of the asset classes invested in by the pension plan and the asset allocation policy currently in place . for purposes of setting and reviewing this assumption , 201clong term 201d refers to the period over which the plan 2019s projected benefit obligations will be disbursed . we review this assumption at each measurement date and adjust it if warranted . our selection process references certain historical data and the current environment , but primarily utilizes qualitative judgment regarding future return expectations . to evaluate the continued reasonableness of our assumption , we examine a variety of viewpoints and data . various studies have shown that portfolios comprised primarily of u.s . equity securities have historically returned approximately 9% ( 9 % ) annually over long periods of time , while u.s . debt securities have returned approximately 6% ( 6 % ) annually over long periods . application of these historical returns to the plan 2019s allocation ranges for equities and bonds produces a result between 6.50% ( 6.50 % ) and 7.25% ( 7.25 % ) and is one point of reference , among many other factors , that is taken into consideration . we also examine the plan 2019s actual historical returns over various periods and consider the current economic environment . recent experience is considered in our evaluation with appropriate consideration that , especially for short time periods , recent returns are not reliable indicators of future returns . while annual returns can vary significantly ( actual returns for 2014 , 2013 and 2012 were +6.50% ( +6.50 % ) , +15.48% ( +15.48 % ) , and +15.29% ( +15.29 % ) , respectively ) , the selected assumption represents our estimated long-term average prospective returns . acknowledging the potentially wide range for this assumption , we also annually examine the assumption used by other companies with similar pension investment strategies , so that we can ascertain whether our determinations markedly differ from others . in all cases , however , this data simply informs our process , which places the greatest emphasis on our qualitative judgment of future investment returns , given the conditions existing at each annual measurement date . taking into consideration all of these factors , the expected long-term return on plan assets for determining net periodic pension cost for 2014 was 7.00% ( 7.00 % ) , down from 7.50% ( 7.50 % ) for 2013 . after considering the views of both internal and external capital market advisors , particularly with regard to the effects of the recent economic environment on long-term prospective fixed income returns , we are reducing our expected long-term return on assets to 6.75% ( 6.75 % ) for determining pension cost for under current accounting rules , the difference between expected long-term returns and actual returns is accumulated and amortized to pension expense over future periods . each one percentage point difference in actual return compared with our expected return can cause expense in subsequent years to increase or decrease by up to $ 9 million as the impact is amortized into results of operations . we currently estimate pretax pension expense of $ 9 million in 2015 compared with pretax income of $ 7 million in 2014 . this year-over-year expected increase in expense reflects the effects of the lower expected return on asset assumption , improved mortality , and the lower discount rate required to be used in 2015 . these factors will be partially offset by the favorable impact of the increase in plan assets at december 31 , 2014 and the assumed return on a $ 200 million voluntary contribution to the plan made in february 2015 . the table below reflects the estimated effects on pension expense of certain changes in annual assumptions , using 2015 estimated expense as a baseline . table 26 : pension expense 2013 sensitivity analysis change in assumption ( a ) estimated increase/ ( decrease ) to 2015 pension expense ( in millions ) .
|change in assumption ( a )|estimatedincrease/ ( decrease ) to 2015pensionexpense ( in millions )|
|.5% ( .5 % ) decrease in discount rate|$ 18|
|.5% ( .5 % ) decrease in expected long-term return on assets|$ 22|
|.5% ( .5 % ) increase in compensation rate|$ 2|
( a ) the impact is the effect of changing the specified assumption while holding all other assumptions constant . our pension plan contribution requirements are not particularly sensitive to actuarial assumptions . investment performance has the most impact on contribution requirements and will drive the amount of required contributions in future years . also , current law , including the provisions of the pension protection act of 2006 , sets limits as to both minimum and maximum contributions to the plan . notwithstanding the voluntary contribution made in february 2015 noted above , we do not expect to be required to make any contributions to the plan during 2015 . we maintain other defined benefit plans that have a less significant effect on financial results , including various nonqualified supplemental retirement plans for certain employees , which are described more fully in note 13 employee benefit plans in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report . 66 the pnc financial services group , inc . 2013 form 10-k .

specified returns based on the returns of an underlying security , referenced asset or index . these transactions include credit-linked notes and equity-linked notes . in these transactions , the spe typically obtains exposure to the underlying security , referenced asset or index through a derivative instrument , such as a total-return swap or a credit-default swap . in turn the spe issues notes to investors that pay a return based on the specified underlying security , referenced asset or index . the spe invests the proceeds in a financial asset or a guaranteed insurance contract ( gic ) that serves as collateral for the derivative contract over the term of the transaction . the company 2019s involvement in these transactions includes being the counterparty to the spe 2019s derivative instruments and investing in a portion of the notes issued by the spe . in certain transactions , the investor 2019s maximum risk of loss is limited and the company absorbs risk of loss above a specified level . the company 2019s maximum risk of loss in these transactions is defined as the amount invested in notes issued by the spe and the notional amount of any risk of loss absorbed by the company through a separate instrument issued by the spe . the derivative instrument held by the company may generate a receivable from the spe ( for example , where the company purchases credit protection from the spe in connection with the spe 2019s issuance of a credit-linked note ) , which is collateralized by the assets owned by the spe . these derivative instruments are not considered

asset-backed commercial paper and medium-term note markets , on december 13 , 2007 , citigroup announced its commitment to provide support facilities that would support the sivs 2019 senior debt ratings . as a result of this commitment , citigroup became the sivs 2019 primary beneficiary and began consolidating these entities . on february 12 , 2008 , citigroup finalized the terms of the support facilities , which took the form of a commitment to provide $ 3.5 billion of mezzanine capital to the sivs in the event the market value of their junior notes approaches zero . the mezzanine capital facility was increased by $ 1 billion to $ 4.5 billion , with the additional commitment funded during the fourth quarter of 2008 . the facilities rank senior to the junior notes but junior to

Context: consolidated income statement review our consolidated income statement is presented in item 8 of this report . net income for 2012 was $ 3.0 billion compared with $ 3.1 billion for 2011 . revenue growth of 8 percent and a decline in the provision for credit losses were more than offset by a 16 percent increase in noninterest expense in 2012 compared to 2011 . further detail is included in the net interest income , noninterest income , provision for credit losses and noninterest expense portions of this consolidated income statement review . net interest income table 2 : net interest income and net interest margin year ended december 31 dollars in millions 2012 2011 .
|year ended december 31dollars in millions|2012|2011|
|net interest income|$ 9640|$ 8700|
|net interest margin|3.94% ( 3.94 % )|3.92% ( 3.92 % )|
changes in net interest income and margin result from the interaction of the volume and composition of interest-earning assets and related yields , interest-bearing liabilities and related rates paid , and noninterest-bearing sources of funding . see the statistical information ( unaudited ) 2013 average consolidated balance sheet and net interest analysis and analysis of year-to-year changes in net interest income in item 8 of this report and the discussion of purchase accounting accretion of purchased impaired loans in the consolidated balance sheet review in this item 7 for additional information . the increase in net interest income in 2012 compared with 2011 was primarily due to the impact of the rbc bank ( usa ) acquisition , organic loan growth and lower funding costs . purchase accounting accretion remained stable at $ 1.1 billion in both periods . the net interest margin was 3.94% ( 3.94 % ) for 2012 and 3.92% ( 3.92 % ) for 2011 . the increase in the comparison was primarily due to a decrease in the weighted-average rate accrued on total interest- bearing liabilities of 29 basis points , largely offset by a 21 basis point decrease on the yield on total interest-earning assets . the decrease in the rate on interest-bearing liabilities was primarily due to the runoff of maturing retail certificates of deposit and the redemption of additional trust preferred and hybrid capital securities during 2012 , in addition to an increase in fhlb borrowings and commercial paper as lower-cost funding sources . the decrease in the yield on interest-earning assets was primarily due to lower rates on new loan volume and lower yields on new securities in the current low rate environment . with respect to the first quarter of 2013 , we expect net interest income to decline by two to three percent compared to fourth quarter 2012 net interest income of $ 2.4 billion , due to a decrease in purchase accounting accretion of up to $ 50 to $ 60 million , including lower expected cash recoveries . for the full year 2013 , we expect net interest income to decrease compared with 2012 , assuming an expected decline in purchase accounting accretion of approximately $ 400 million , while core net interest income is expected to increase in the year-over-year comparison . we believe our net interest margin will come under pressure in 2013 , due to the expected decline in purchase accounting accretion and assuming that the current low rate environment continues . noninterest income noninterest income totaled $ 5.9 billion for 2012 and $ 5.6 billion for 2011 . the overall increase in the comparison was primarily due to an increase in residential mortgage loan sales revenue driven by higher loan origination volume , gains on sales of visa class b common shares and higher corporate service fees , largely offset by higher provision for residential mortgage repurchase obligations . asset management revenue , including blackrock , totaled $ 1.2 billion in 2012 compared with $ 1.1 billion in 2011 . this increase was primarily due to higher earnings from our blackrock investment . discretionary assets under management increased to $ 112 billion at december 31 , 2012 compared with $ 107 billion at december 31 , 2011 driven by stronger average equity markets , positive net flows and strong sales performance . for 2012 , consumer services fees were $ 1.1 billion compared with $ 1.2 billion in 2011 . the decline reflected the regulatory impact of lower interchange fees on debit card transactions partially offset by customer growth . as further discussed in the retail banking portion of the business segments review section of this item 7 , the dodd-frank limits on interchange rates were effective october 1 , 2011 and had a negative impact on revenue of approximately $ 314 million in 2012 and $ 75 million in 2011 . this impact was partially offset by higher volumes of merchant , customer credit card and debit card transactions and the impact of the rbc bank ( usa ) acquisition . corporate services revenue increased by $ .3 billion , or 30 percent , to $ 1.2 billion in 2012 compared with $ .9 billion in 2011 due to higher commercial mortgage servicing revenue and higher merger and acquisition advisory fees in 2012 . the major components of corporate services revenue are treasury management revenue , corporate finance fees , including revenue from capital markets-related products and services , and commercial mortgage servicing revenue , including commercial mortgage banking activities . see the product revenue portion of this consolidated income statement review for further detail . the pnc financial services group , inc . 2013 form 10-k 39 .

as of december 31 , 2010 , the liability for uncertain income tax positions was $ 2.7 million . due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding timing of potential future cash flows associated with these liabilities , we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period in which these liabilities might be paid . we utilize blanket purchase orders to communicate expected annual requirements to many of our suppliers . requirements under blanket purchase orders generally do not become committed until several weeks prior to the company 2019s scheduled unit production . the purchase obligation amount presented above represents the value of commitments considered firm . results of operations our sales from continuing operations in 2010 were $ 1489.3 million surpassing 2009 sales of $ 1375.0 million by 8.3 percent . the increase in sales was due mostly to significantly higher sales in our water heater operations in china resulting from geographic expansion , market share gains and new product introductions as well as additional sales from our water treatment business acquired in november , 2009 . our sales from continuing operations were $ 1451.3 million in 2008 . the $ 76.3 million decline in sales from 2008 to 2009 was due to lower residential and commercial volume in north america , reflecting softness in the domestic housing market and a slowdown in the commercial water heater business and was partially offset by strong growth in water heater sales in china and improved year over year pricing . on december 13 , 2010 we entered into a definitive agreement to sell our electrical products company to regal beloit corporation for $ 700 million in cash and approximately 2.83 million shares of regal beloit common stock . the transaction , which has been approved by both companies' board of directors , is expected to close in the first half of 2011 . due to the pending sale , our electrical products segment has been accorded discontinued operations treatment in the accompanying financial statements . sales in 2010 , including sales of $ 701.8 million for our electrical products segment , were $ 2191.1 million . our gross profit margin for continuing operations in 2010 was 29.9 percent , compared with 28.7 percent in 2009 and 25.8 percent in 2008 . the improvement in margin from 2009 to 2010 was due to increased volume , cost containment activities and lower warranty costs which more than offset certain inefficiencies resulting from the may flood in our ashland city , tn water heater manufacturing facility . the increase in profit margin from 2008 to 2009 resulted from increased higher margin china water heater volume , aggressive cost reduction programs and lower material costs . selling , general and administrative expense ( sg&a ) was $ 36.9 million higher in 2010 than in 2009 . the increased sg&a , the majority of which was incurred in our china water heater operation , was associated with selling costs to support higher volume and new product lines . additional sg&a associated with our 2009 water treatment acquisition also contributed to the increase . sg&a was $ 8.5 million higher in 2009 than 2008 resulting mostly from an $ 8.2 million increase in our china water heater operation in support of higher volumes. .

the demand for property and casualty insurance generally rises as the overall level of economic activity increases and generally falls as such activity decreases , affecting both the commissions and fees generated by our brokerage business . the economic activity that impacts property and casualty insurance is described as exposure units , and is most closely correlated with employment levels , corporate revenue and asset values . during 2014 , pricing was flat on average globally , and we would still consider this to be a ""soft market."" in a soft market , premium rates flatten or decrease , along with commission revenues , due to increased competition for market share among insurance carriers or increased underwriting capacity . changes in premiums have a direct and potentially material impact on the insurance brokerage industry , as commission revenues are generally based on a percentage of the premiums paid by insureds . additionally , continuing through 2014 , we faced difficult conditions as a result of continued weakness in the global economy , the repricing of credit risk and the deterioration of the financial markets . weak economic conditions in many markets around the globe have reduced our customers' demand for our retail brokerage and reinsurance brokerage products , which have had a negative impact on our operational results . risk solutions generated approximately 65% ( 65 % ) of our consolidated total revenues in 2014 . revenues are generated primarily through fees paid by clients , commissions and fees paid by insurance and reinsurance companies , and investment income on funds held on behalf of clients . our revenues vary from quarter to quarter throughout the year as a result of the timing of our clients' policy renewals , the net effect of new and lost business , the timing of services provided to our clients , and the income we earn on investments , which is heavily influenced by short-term interest rates . we operate in a highly competitive industry and compete with many retail insurance brokerage and agency firms , as well as with individual brokers , agents , and direct writers of insurance coverage . specifically , we address the highly specialized .

Context: provision for income taxes increased $ 1791 million in 2012 from 2011 primarily due to the increase in pretax income from continuing operations , including the impact of the resumption of sales in libya in the first quarter of 2012 . the following is an analysis of the effective income tax rates for 2012 and 2011: .
||2012|2011|
|statutory rate applied to income from continuing operations before income taxes|35% ( 35 % )|35% ( 35 % )|

|adjustments to valuation allowances|21|14|
|tax law changes|2014|1|
|effective income tax rate on continuing operations|74% ( 74 % )|61% ( 61 % )|
the effective income tax rate is influenced by a variety of factors including the geographic sources of income and the relative magnitude of these sources of income . the provision for income taxes is allocated on a discrete , stand-alone basis to pretax segment income and to individual items not allocated to segments . the difference between the total provision and the sum of the amounts allocated to segments appears in the ""corporate and other unallocated items"" shown in the reconciliation of segment income to net income below . effects of foreign operations 2013 the effects of foreign operations on our effective tax rate increased in 2012 as compared to 2011 , primarily due to the resumption of sales in libya in the first quarter of 2012 , where the statutory rate is in excess of 90 percent . change in permanent reinvestment assertion 2013 in the second quarter of 2011 , we recorded $ 716 million of deferred u.s . tax on undistributed earnings of $ 2046 million that we previously intended to permanently reinvest in foreign operations . offsetting this tax expense were associated foreign tax credits of $ 488 million . in addition , we reduced our valuation allowance related to foreign tax credits by $ 228 million due to recognizing deferred u.s . tax on previously undistributed earnings . adjustments to valuation allowances 2013 in 2012 and 2011 , we increased the valuation allowance against foreign tax credits because it is more likely than not that we will be unable to realize all u.s . benefits on foreign taxes accrued in those years . see item 8 . financial statements and supplementary data - note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about income taxes . discontinued operations is presented net of tax , and reflects our downstream business that was spun off june 30 , 2011 and our angola business which we agreed to sell in 2013 . see item 8 . financial statements and supplementary data 2013 notes 3 and 6 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. .

Context: entergy arkansas , inc . management's financial discussion and analysis operating activities cash flow from operations increased $ 8.8 million in 2004 compared to 2003 primarily due to income tax benefits received in 2004 , and increased recovery of deferred fuel costs . this increase was substantially offset by money pool activity . in 2003 , the domestic utility companies and system energy filed , with the irs , a change in tax accounting method notification for their respective calculations of cost of goods sold . the adjustment implemented a simplified method of allocation of overhead to the production of electricity , which is provided under the irs capitalization regulations . the cumulative adjustment placing these companies on the new methodology resulted in a $ 1.171 billion deduction for entergy arkansas on entergy's 2003 income tax return . there was no cash benefit from the method change in 2003 . in 2004 , entergy arkansas realized $ 173 million in cash tax benefit from the method change . this tax accounting method change is an issue across the utility industry and will likely be challenged by the irs on audit . as of december 31 , 2004 , entergy arkansas has a net operating loss ( nol ) carryforward for tax purposes of $ 766.9 million , principally resulting from the change in tax accounting method related to cost of goods sold . if the tax accounting method change is sustained , entergy arkansas expects to utilize the nol carryforward through 2006 . cash flow from operations increased $ 80.1 million in 2003 compared to 2002 primarily due to income taxes paid of $ 2.2 million in 2003 compared to income taxes paid of $ 83.9 million in 2002 , and money pool activity . this increase was partially offset by decreased recovery of deferred fuel costs in 2003 . entergy arkansas' receivables from or ( payables to ) the money pool were as follows as of december 31 for each of the following years: .

money pool activity used $ 92.7 million of entergy arkansas' operating cash flow in 2004 , provided $ 73.4 million in 2003 , and provided $ 19.5 million in 2002 . see note 4 to the domestic utility companies and system energy financial statements for a description of the money pool . investing activities the decrease of $ 68.1 million in net cash used in investing activities in 2004 compared to 2003 was primarily due to a decrease in construction expenditures resulting from less transmission upgrade work requested by merchant generators in 2004 combined with lower spending on customer support projects in 2004 . the increase of $ 88.1 million in net cash used in investing activities in 2003 compared to 2002 was primarily due to an increase in construction expenditures of $ 57.4 million and the maturity of $ 38.4 million of other temporary investments in the first quarter of 2002 . construction expenditures increased in 2003 primarily due to the following : 2022 a ferc ruling that shifted responsibility for transmission upgrade work performed for independent power producers to entergy arkansas ; and 2022 the ano 1 steam generator , reactor vessel head , and transformer replacement project . financing activities the decrease of $ 90.7 million in net cash used in financing activities in 2004 compared to 2003 was primarily due to the net redemption of $ 2.4 million of long-term debt in 2004 compared to $ 109.3 million in 2003 , partially offset by the payment of $ 16.2 million more in common stock dividends during the same period. .

1 . includes net revenues related to reinsurance of $ 1.08 billion , $ 880 million and $ 827 million for the years ended december 2012 , december 2011 and december 2010 , respectively . 2012 versus 2011 . net revenues in institutional client services were $ 18.12 billion for 2012 , 5% ( 5 % ) higher than 2011 . net revenues in fixed income , currency and commodities client execution were $ 9.91 billion for 2012 , 10% ( 10 % ) higher than 2011 . these results reflected strong net revenues in mortgages , which were significantly higher compared with 2011 . in addition , net revenues in credit products and interest rate products were solid and higher compared with 2011 . these increases were partially offset by significantly lower net revenues in commodities and slightly lower net revenues in currencies . although broad market concerns persisted during 2012 , fixed income , currency and commodities client execution operated in a generally improved environment characterized by tighter credit spreads and less challenging market-making conditions compared with 2011 . net revenues in equities were $ 8.21 billion for 2012 , essentially unchanged compared with 2011 . net revenues in securities services were significantly higher compared with 2011 , reflecting a gain of approximately $ 500 million on the sale of our hedge fund administration business . in addition , equities client execution net revenues were higher than 2011 , primarily reflecting significantly higher results in cash products , principally due to increased levels of client activity . these increases were offset by lower commissions and fees , reflecting lower market volumes . during 2012 , equities operated in an environment generally characterized by an increase in global equity prices and lower volatility levels . the net loss attributable to the impact of changes in our own credit spreads on borrowings for which the fair value option was elected was $ 714 million ( $ 433 million and $ 281 million related to fixed income , currency and commodities client execution and equities client execution , respectively ) for 2012 , compared with a net gain of $ 596 million ( $ 399 million and $ 197 million related to fixed income , currency and commodities client execution and equities client execution , respectively ) for 2011 . during 2012 , institutional client services operated in an environment generally characterized by continued broad market concerns and uncertainties , although positive developments helped to improve market conditions . these developments included certain central bank actions to ease monetary policy and address funding risks for european financial institutions . in addition , the u.s . economy posted stable to improving economic data , including favorable developments in unemployment and housing . these improvements resulted in tighter credit spreads , higher global equity prices and lower levels of volatility . however , concerns about the outlook for the global economy and continued political uncertainty , particularly the political debate in the united states surrounding the fiscal cliff , generally resulted in client risk aversion and lower activity levels . also , uncertainty over financial regulatory reform persisted . if these concerns and uncertainties continue over the long term , net revenues in fixed income , currency and commodities client execution and equities would likely be negatively impacted . operating expenses were $ 12.48 billion for 2012 , 3% ( 3 % ) lower than 2011 , primarily due to lower brokerage , clearing , exchange and distribution fees , and lower impairment charges , partially offset by higher net provisions for litigation and regulatory proceedings . pre-tax earnings were $ 5.64 billion in 2012 , 27% ( 27 % ) higher than 2011 . 2011 versus 2010 . net revenues in institutional client services were $ 17.28 billion for 2011 , 21% ( 21 % ) lower than 2010 . net revenues in fixed income , currency and commodities client execution were $ 9.02 billion for 2011 , 34% ( 34 % ) lower than 2010 . although activity levels during 2011 were generally consistent with 2010 levels , and results were solid during the first quarter of 2011 , the environment during the remainder of 2011 was characterized by broad market concerns and uncertainty , resulting in volatile markets and significantly wider credit spreads , which contributed to difficult market-making conditions and led to reductions in risk by us and our clients . as a result of these conditions , net revenues across the franchise were lower , including significant declines in mortgages and credit products , compared with 2010 . 54 goldman sachs 2012 annual report .

net sales net sales increased by $ 154.6 million , or 8.9% ( 8.9 % ) , for the year ended december 31 , 2004 from the year ended december 31 , 2003 . net sales increased due to improved sales volumes and prices of corrugated products and containerboard compared to 2003 . total corrugated products volume sold increased 6.6% ( 6.6 % ) to 29.9 billion square feet in 2004 compared to 28.1 billion square feet in 2003 . on a comparable shipment-per-workday basis , corrugated products sales volume increased 7.0% ( 7.0 % ) in 2004 from 2003 . excluding pca 2019s acquisition of acorn in february 2004 , corrugated products volume was 5.3% ( 5.3 % ) higher in 2004 than 2003 and up 5.8% ( 5.8 % ) compared to 2003 on a shipment-per-workday basis . shipments-per-workday is calculated by dividing our total corrugated products volume during the year by the number of workdays within the year . the larger percentage increase was due to the fact that 2004 had one less workday ( 251 days ) , those days not falling on a weekend or holiday , than 2003 ( 252 days ) . containerboard sales volume to external domestic and export customers increased 6.8% ( 6.8 % ) to 475000 tons for the year ended december 31 , 2004 from 445000 tons in 2003 . income before interest and taxes income before interest and taxes increased by $ 43.6 million , or 45.1% ( 45.1 % ) , for the year ended december 31 , 2004 compared to 2003 . included in income before interest and taxes for the year ended december 31 , 2004 is income of $ 27.8 million , net of expenses , attributable to a dividend paid to pca by stv , the timberlands joint venture in which pca owns a 311 20443% ( 20443 % ) ownership interest . included in income before interest and taxes for the year ended december 31 , 2003 is a $ 3.3 million charge for fees and expenses related to the company 2019s debt refinancing which was completed in july 2003 , and a fourth quarter charge of $ 16.0 million to settle certain benefits related matters with pactiv corporation dating back to april 12 , 1999 when pca became a stand-alone company , as described below . during the fourth quarter of 2003 , pactiv notified pca that we owed pactiv additional amounts for hourly pension benefits and workers 2019 compensation liabilities dating back to april 12 , 1999 . a settlement of $ 16.0 million was negotiated between pactiv and pca in december 2003 . the full amount of the settlement was accrued in the fourth quarter of 2003 . excluding these special items , operating income decreased $ 3.4 million in 2004 compared to 2003 . the $ 3.4 million decrease in income before interest and taxes was primarily attributable to increased energy and transportation costs ( $ 19.2 million ) , higher recycled and wood fiber costs ( $ 16.7 million ) , increased salary expenses related to annual increases and new hires ( $ 5.7 million ) , and increased contractual hourly labor costs ( $ 5.6 million ) , which was partially offset by increased sales volume and sales prices ( $ 44.3 million ) . .

( a ) these hedges do not qualify for hedge accounting under u.s . gaap . lending-related commitments jpmorgan chase uses lending-related financial instruments , such as commitments and guarantees , to meet the financing needs of its customers . the contractual amount of these financial instruments represents the maximum possible credit risk should the counterpar- ties draw down on these commitments or the firm fulfills its obliga- tion under these guarantees , and should the counterparties subsequently fail to perform according to the terms of these con- tracts . wholesale lending-related commitments were $ 346.1 billion at december 31 , 2010 , compared with $ 347.2 billion at december 31 , 2009 . the decrease reflected the january 1 , 2010 , adoption of accounting guidance related to vies . excluding the effect of the accounting guidance , lending-related commitments would have increased by $ 16.6 billion . in the firm 2019s view , the total contractual amount of these wholesale lending-related commitments is not representative of the firm 2019s actual credit risk exposure or funding requirements . in determining the amount of credit risk exposure the firm has to wholesale lend- ing-related commitments , which is used as the basis for allocating credit risk capital to these commitments , the firm has established a 201cloan-equivalent 201d amount for each commitment ; this amount represents the portion of the unused commitment or other contin- gent exposure that is expected , based on average portfolio histori- cal experience , to become drawn upon in an event of a default by an obligor . the loan-equivalent amounts of the firm 2019s lending- related commitments were $ 189.9 billion and $ 179.8 billion as of december 31 , 2010 and 2009 , respectively . country exposure the firm 2019s wholesale portfolio includes country risk exposures to both developed and emerging markets . the firm seeks to diversify its country exposures , including its credit-related lending , trading and investment activities , whether cross-border or locally funded . country exposure under the firm 2019s internal risk management ap- proach is reported based on the country where the assets of the obligor , counterparty or guarantor are located . exposure amounts , including resale agreements , are adjusted for collateral and for credit enhancements ( e.g. , guarantees and letters of credit ) pro- vided by third parties ; outstandings supported by a guarantor located outside the country or backed by collateral held outside the country are assigned to the country of the enhancement provider . in addition , the effect of credit derivative hedges and other short credit or equity trading positions are taken into consideration . total exposure measures include activity with both government and private-sector entities in a country . the firm also reports country exposure for regulatory purposes following ffiec guidelines , which are different from the firm 2019s internal risk management approach for measuring country expo- sure . for additional information on the ffiec exposures , see cross- border outstandings on page 314 of this annual report . several european countries , including greece , portugal , spain , italy and ireland , have been subject to credit deterioration due to weak- nesses in their economic and fiscal situations . the firm is closely monitoring its exposures to these five countries . aggregate net exposures to these five countries as measured under the firm 2019s internal approach was less than $ 15.0 billion at december 31 , 2010 , with no country representing a majority of the exposure . sovereign exposure in all five countries represented less than half the aggregate net exposure . the firm currently believes its exposure to these five countries is modest relative to the firm 2019s overall risk expo- sures and is manageable given the size and types of exposures to each of the countries and the diversification of the aggregate expo- sure . the firm continues to conduct business and support client activity in these countries and , therefore , the firm 2019s aggregate net exposures may vary over time . in addition , the net exposures may be impacted by changes in market conditions , and the effects of interest rates and credit spreads on market valuations . as part of its ongoing country risk management process , the firm monitors exposure to emerging market countries , and utilizes country stress tests to measure and manage the risk of extreme loss associated with a sovereign crisis . there is no common definition of emerging markets , but the firm generally includes in its definition those countries whose sovereign debt ratings are equivalent to 201ca+ 201d or lower . the table below presents the firm 2019s exposure to its top 10 emerging markets countries based on its internal measure- ment approach . the selection of countries is based solely on the firm 2019s largest total exposures by country and does not represent its view of any actual or potentially adverse credit conditions. .

Context: 2015 compared to 2014 mfc 2019s net sales in 2015 decreased $ 322 million , or 5% ( 5 % ) , compared to the same period in 2014 . the decrease was attributable to lower net sales of approximately $ 345 million for air and missile defense programs due to fewer deliveries ( primarily pac-3 ) and lower volume ( primarily thaad ) ; and approximately $ 85 million for tactical missile programs due to fewer deliveries ( primarily guided multiple launch rocket system ( gmlrs ) ) and joint air-to-surface standoff missile , partially offset by increased deliveries for hellfire . these decreases were partially offset by higher net sales of approximately $ 55 million for energy solutions programs due to increased volume . mfc 2019s operating profit in 2015 decreased $ 62 million , or 5% ( 5 % ) , compared to 2014 . the decrease was attributable to lower operating profit of approximately $ 100 million for fire control programs due primarily to lower risk retirements ( primarily lantirn and sniper ) ; and approximately $ 65 million for tactical missile programs due to lower risk retirements ( primarily hellfire and gmlrs ) and fewer deliveries . these decreases were partially offset by higher operating profit of approximately $ 75 million for air and missile defense programs due to increased risk retirements ( primarily thaad ) . adjustments not related to volume , including net profit booking rate adjustments and other matters , were approximately $ 60 million lower in 2015 compared to 2014 . backlog backlog decreased in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to lower orders on pac-3 , hellfire , and jassm . backlog increased in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to higher orders on pac-3 , lantirn/sniper and certain tactical missile programs , partially offset by lower orders on thaad . trends we expect mfc 2019s net sales to increase in the mid-single digit percentage range in 2017 as compared to 2016 driven primarily by our air and missile defense programs . operating profit is expected to be flat or increase slightly . accordingly , operating profit margin is expected to decline from 2016 levels as a result of contract mix and fewer risk retirements in 2017 compared to 2016 . rotary and mission systems as previously described , on november 6 , 2015 , we acquired sikorsky and aligned the sikorsky business under our rms business segment . the 2015 results of the acquired sikorsky business have been included in our financial results from the november 6 , 2015 acquisition date through december 31 , 2015 . as a result , our consolidated operating results and rms business segment operating results for the year ended december 31 , 2015 do not reflect a full year of sikorsky operations . our rms business segment provides design , manufacture , service and support for a variety of military and civil helicopters , ship and submarine mission and combat systems ; mission systems and sensors for rotary and fixed-wing aircraft ; sea and land-based missile defense systems ; radar systems ; the littoral combat ship ( lcs ) ; simulation and training services ; and unmanned systems and technologies . in addition , rms supports the needs of government customers in cybersecurity and delivers communication and command and control capabilities through complex mission solutions for defense applications . rms 2019 major programs include black hawk and seahawk helicopters , aegis combat system ( aegis ) , lcs , space fence , advanced hawkeye radar system , tpq-53 radar system , ch-53k development helicopter , and vh-92a helicopter program . rms 2019 operating results included the following ( in millions ) : .

2016 compared to 2015 rms 2019 net sales in 2016 increased $ 4.4 billion , or 48% ( 48 % ) , compared to 2015 . the increase was primarily attributable to higher net sales of approximately $ 4.6 billion from sikorsky , which was acquired on november 6 , 2015 . net sales for 2015 include sikorsky 2019s results subsequent to the acquisition date , net of certain revenue adjustments required to account for the acquisition of this business . this increase was partially offset by lower net sales of approximately $ 70 million for training .

cash flows received on retained interests and other net cash flows 0.5 2014 2014 municipal investments municipal investment transactions represent partnerships that finance the construction and rehabilitation of low-income affordable rental housing . the company generally invests in these partnerships as a limited partner and earns a return primarily through the receipt of tax credits earned from the affordable housing investments made by the partnership . client intermediation client intermediation transactions represent a range of transactions designed to provide investors with specified returns based on the returns of an underlying security , referenced asset or index . these transactions include credit-linked notes and equity-linked notes . in these transactions , the spe typically obtains exposure to the underlying security , referenced asset or index through a derivative instrument , such as a total-return swap or a credit-default swap . in turn the spe issues notes to investors that pay a return based on the specified underlying security , referenced asset or index . the spe invests the proceeds in a financial asset or a guaranteed insurance contract ( gic ) that serves as collateral for the derivative contract over the term of the transaction . the company 2019s involvement in these transactions includes being the counterparty to the spe 2019s derivative instruments and investing in a portion of the notes issued by the spe . in certain transactions , the investor 2019s maximum risk of loss is limited and the company absorbs risk of loss above a specified level . the company 2019s maximum risk of loss in these transactions is defined as the amount invested in notes issued by the spe and the notional amount of any risk of loss absorbed by the company through a separate instrument issued by the spe . the derivative instrument held by the company may generate a receivable from the spe ( for example , where the company purchases credit protection from the spe in connection with the spe 2019s issuance of a credit-linked note ) , which is collateralized by the assets owned by the spe . these derivative instruments are not considered variable interests under fin 46 ( r ) and any associated receivables are not included in the calculation of maximum exposure to the spe . structured investment vehicles structured investment vehicles ( sivs ) are spes that issue junior notes and senior debt ( medium-term notes and short-term commercial paper ) to fund the purchase of high quality assets . the junior notes are subject to the

high quality assets . the company acts as manager for the sivs and , prior to december 13 , 2007 , was not contractually obligated to provide liquidity facilities or guarantees to the sivs . in response to the ratings review of the outstanding senior debt of the sivs for a possible downgrade announced by two ratings agencies and the continued reduction of liquidity in the siv-related asset-backed commercial paper and medium-term note markets , on december 13 , 2007 , citigroup announced its commitment to provide support facilities that would support the sivs 2019 senior debt ratings . as a result of this commitment , citigroup became the sivs 2019 primary beneficiary and began consolidating these entities . on february 12 , 2008 , citigroup finalized the terms of the support facilities , which took the form of a commitment to provide $ 3.5 billion of mezzanine capital to the sivs in the event the market value of their junior notes approaches zero . the mezzanine capital facility was increased by $ 1 billion to $ 4.5 billion , with the additional commitment funded during the fourth quarter of 2008 . the facilities rank senior to the junior notes but junior to the commercial paper and medium-term notes . the facilities were at arm 2019s-length terms . interest was paid on the drawn amount of the facilities and a per annum fee was paid on the unused portion . during the period to november 18 , 2008 , the company wrote down $ 3.3 billion on siv assets . in order to complete the wind-down of the sivs , the company , in a nearly cashless transaction , purchased the remaining assets of the sivs at fair value , with a trade date of november 18 , 2008 . the company funded the purchase of the siv assets by assuming the obligation to pay amounts due under the medium-term notes issued by the sivs , as the medium-term notes mature . the net funding provided by the company to fund the purchase of the siv assets was $ 0.3 billion . as of december 31

2022 at the lower of cost or fair value , with valuation changes record- ed in noninterest revenue , for loans that are classified as held- for-sale ; or 2022 at fair value , with changes in fair value recorded in noninterest revenue , for loans classified as trading assets or risk managed on a fair value basis ; 2022 purchased credit-impaired loans held for investment are account- ed for under sop 03-3 and initially measured at fair value , which includes estimated future credit losses . accordingly , an allowance for loan losses related to these loans is not recorded at the acquisition date . see note 5 on pages 156 2013158 of this annual report for further information on the firm 2019s elections of fair value accounting under sfas 159 . see note 6 on pages 158 2013160 of this annual report for further information on loans carried at fair value and classified as trading assets . for loans held for investment , other than purchased credit-impaired loans , interest income is recognized using the interest method or on a basis approximating a level rate of return over the term of the loan . loans within the held-for-investment portfolio that management decides to sell are transferred to the held-for-sale portfolio . transfers to held-for-sale are recorded at the lower of cost or fair value on the date of transfer . credit-related losses are charged off to the allowance for loan losses and losses due to changes in interest rates , or exchange rates , are recognized in noninterest revenue . loans within the held-for-sale portfolio that management decides to retain are transferred to the held-for-investment portfolio at the lower of cost or fair value . these loans are subsequently assessed for impairment based on the firm 2019s allowance methodology . for a fur- ther discussion of the methodologies used in establishing the firm 2019s allowance for loan losses , see note 15 on pages 178 2013180 of this annual report . nonaccrual loans are those on which the accrual of interest is dis- continued . loans ( other than certain consumer and purchased credit- impaired loans discussed below ) are placed on nonaccrual status immediately if , in the opinion of management , full payment of princi- pal or interest is in doubt , or when principal or interest is 90 days or more past due and collateral , if any , is insufficient to cover principal and interest . loans are charged off to the allowance for loan losses when it is highly certain that a loss has been realized . interest accrued but not collected at the date a loan is placed on nonaccrual status is reversed against interest income . in addition , the amortiza- tion of net deferred loan fees is suspended . interest income on nonaccrual loans is recognized only to the extent it is received in cash . however , where there is doubt regarding the ultimate col- lectibility of loan principal , all cash thereafter received is applied to reduce the carrying value of such loans ( i.e. , the cost recovery method ) . loans are restored to accrual status only when future pay- ments of interest and principal are reasonably assured . consumer loans , other than purchased credit-impaired loans , are generally charged to the allowance for loan losses upon reaching specified stages of delinquency , in accordance with the federal financial institutions examination council policy . for example , credit card loans are charged off by the end of the month in which the account becomes 180 days past due or within 60 days from receiv- ing notification of the filing of bankruptcy , whichever is earlier . residential mortgage products are generally charged off to net real- izable value at no later than 180 days past due . other consumer .

Context: financial statement impact we believe that our accruals for sales returns , rebates , and discounts are reasonable and appropriate based on current facts and circumstances . our global rebate and discount liabilities are included in sales rebates and discounts on our consolidated balance sheet . our global sales return liability is included in other current liabilities and other noncurrent liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet . as of december 31 , 2018 , a 5 percent change in our global sales return , rebate , and discount liability would have led to an approximate $ 275 million effect on our income before income taxes . the portion of our global sales return , rebate , and discount liability resulting from sales of our products in the u.s . was approximately 90 percent as of december 31 , 2018 and december 31 , 2017 . the following represents a roll-forward of our most significant u.s . pharmaceutical sales return , rebate , and discount liability balances , including managed care , medicare , and medicaid: .

( 1 ) adjustments of the estimates for these returns , rebates , and discounts to actual results were approximately 1 percent of consolidated net sales for each of the years presented . product litigation liabilities and other contingencies background and uncertainties product litigation liabilities and other contingencies are , by their nature , uncertain and based upon complex judgments and probabilities . the factors we consider in developing our product litigation liability reserves and other contingent liability amounts include the merits and jurisdiction of the litigation , the nature and the number of other similar current and past matters , the nature of the product and the current assessment of the science subject to the litigation , and the likelihood of settlement and current state of settlement discussions , if any . in addition , we accrue for certain product liability claims incurred , but not filed , to the extent we can formulate a reasonable estimate of their costs based primarily on historical claims experience and data regarding product usage . we accrue legal defense costs expected to be incurred in connection with significant product liability contingencies when both probable and reasonably estimable . we also consider the insurance coverage we have to diminish the exposure for periods covered by insurance . in assessing our insurance coverage , we consider the policy coverage limits and exclusions , the potential for denial of coverage by the insurance company , the financial condition of the insurers , and the possibility of and length of time for collection . due to a very restrictive market for product liability insurance , we are self-insured for product liability losses for all our currently marketed products . in addition to insurance coverage , we also consider any third-party indemnification to which we are entitled or under which we are obligated . with respect to our third-party indemnification rights , these considerations include the nature of the indemnification , the financial condition of the indemnifying party , and the possibility of and length of time for collection . the litigation accruals and environmental liabilities and the related estimated insurance recoverables have been reflected on a gross basis as liabilities and assets , respectively , on our consolidated balance sheets . impairment of indefinite-lived and long-lived assets background and uncertainties we review the carrying value of long-lived assets ( both intangible and tangible ) for potential impairment on a periodic basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset ( or asset group ) may not be recoverable . we identify impairment by comparing the projected undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the asset ( or asset group ) to its carrying value . if an impairment is identified , a loss is recorded equal to the excess of the asset 2019s net book value over its fair value , and the cost basis is adjusted . goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment at least annually and when certain impairment indicators are present . when required , a comparison of fair value to the carrying amount of assets is performed to determine the amount of any impairment. .

Context: hii expects to incur higher costs to complete ships currently under construction in avondale due to anticipated reductions in productivity . as a result , in the second quarter of 2010 , the company increased the estimates to complete lpd-23 and lpd-25 by approximately $ 210 million . the company recognized a $ 113 million pre-tax charge to operating income for these contracts in the second quarter of 2010 . hii is exploring alternative uses of the avondale facility , including alternative opportunities for the workforce . in connection with and as a result of the decision to wind down shipbuilding operations at the avondale , louisiana facility , the company began incurring and paying related employee severance and incentive compensation liabilities and expenditures , asset retirement obligation liabilities that became reasonably estimable , and amounts owed for not meeting certain requirements under its cooperative endeavor agreement with the state of louisiana . the company anticipates that it will incur substantial other restructuring and facilities shutdown related costs , including , but not limited to , severance expense , relocation expense , and asset write-downs related to the avondale facilities . these costs are expected to be allowable expenses under government accounting standards and thus should be recoverable in future years 2019 overhead costs . these future costs could approximate $ 271 million , based on management 2019s current estimate . such costs should be recoverable under existing flexibly priced contracts or future negotiated contracts in accordance with federal acquisition regulation ( 201cfar 201d ) provisions relating to the treatment of restructuring and shutdown related costs . the company is currently in discussions with the u.s . navy regarding its cost submission to support the recoverability of these costs under the far and applicable contracts , and this submission is subject to review and acceptance by the u.s . navy . the defense contract audit agency ( 201cdcaa 201d ) , a dod agency , prepared an initial audit report on the company 2019s cost proposal for restructuring and shutdown related costs of $ 310 million , which stated that the proposal was not adequately supported for the dcaa to reach a conclusion and questioned approximately $ 25 million , or 8% ( 8 % ) , of the costs submitted by the company . accordingly , the dcaa did not accept the proposal as submitted . the company has submitted a revised proposal to address the concerns of the dcaa and to reflect a revised estimated total cost of $ 271 million . should the company 2019s revised proposal be challenged by the u.s . navy , the company would likely pursue prescribed dispute resolution alternatives to resolve the challenge . that process , however , would create uncertainty as to the timing and eventual allowability of the costs related to the wind down of the avondale facility . ultimately , the company anticipates these discussions with the u.s . navy will result in an agreement that is substantially in accordance with management 2019s cost recovery expectations . accordingly , hii has treated these costs as allowable costs in determining the earnings performance on its contracts in process . the actual restructuring expenses related to the wind down may be greater than the company 2019s current estimate , and any inability to recover such costs could result in a material effect on the company 2019s consolidated financial position , results of operations or cash flows . the company also evaluated the effect that the wind down of the avondale facilities might have on the benefit plans in which hii employees participate . hii determined that the potential impact of a curtailment in these plans was not material to its consolidated financial position , results of operations or cash flows . the table below summarizes the company 2019s liability for restructuring and shutdown related costs associated with winding down the avondale facility . as of december 31 , 2011 and 2010 , these costs are comprised primarily of employee severance and retention and incentive bonuses . these amounts were capitalized in inventoried costs , and will be recognized as expenses in cost of product sales beginning in 2014 .
